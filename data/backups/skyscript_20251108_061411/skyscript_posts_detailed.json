It’s also linked into the Members Area, together with the other showreels available there.\nWade’s presentation examined the origin of the split opinion on whether the Part of Fortune should be reversed in nocturnal charts. Considering the major role that this part plays in many astrological techniques this is a matter of considerable significance.\nAfter the talk I asked Wade if he might be willing to summarise the key points in an accessible article that could be shared on Skyscript, linking to the full video for those who want deeper context. I’m happy to say he’s agreed, and we hope to publish that before the end of the month. Once it’s up, I’ll also open a public Skyscript forum post so that this issue can be discussed more broadly amongst the community, with an opportunity for further input and exploration.\n\n━━━━ ✦ ✦ ━━━━━━━━ ✦ ✦ ━━━━\nUpcoming events\nRemember to check the Members Area for details of all past and upcoming events and publications.\nWe will meet again at 8.30 pm UTC on Sunday 19th October for the second meeting of the England’s Prophetical Merlin Reading Group.\nOur next speaker presentation will take place on Thursday 13th November, when Simão Cortês will discuss some of the horoscopes and judgements recorded in the casebooks of Jerome Cardan.\nSimão Cortês is a Portuguese astrologer and teacher now based in Canterbury, UK, where he is completing his PhD. He works in horary and natal astrology, specialising in remedial techniques. He trained with CEIA and the Company of Astrologers. He holds an MA in Myth, Cosmology and the Sacred from Canterbury Christ Church University, where he wrote on the pedagogy of astrology. He is founder of Duranki, a community devoted to astrology, magic, and dream work. He teaches in multiple countries and recently translated Geoffrey Cornelius’s The Moment of Astrology into Portuguese.\n━━━━ ✦ ✦ ━━━━━━━━ ✦ ✦ ━━━━\nSkyscript Members Area: https://www.skyscript.co.uk/patron/news.php\nZoom link: http://us06web.zoom.us/j/6123333126\nMeeting password = Skyscript\n3 comments\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n4w\nThank goodness for the recordings !!

I hope to publish that soon and open a public discussion area in the Skyscript forum. But since Wade doesn’t have easy access to these comments, let me offer a few of my own thoughts for what they’re worth.\n\nOn your first point – why should the Ascendant be of the Sun when everything rises there? I think there’s an intrinsic relationship between the Sun and the Ascendant, and a counter-relationship between the Moon and the Descendant, which is quite widely acknowledged in historical and traditional texts. Think about the principle of the Sun astrologically: it signifies life and vitality, while the absence of its light symbolises decline and death. These are exactly the principles embedded into the symbolism of those points – the Ascendant representing life and emergence, and the Descendant representing retreat and the turning inward of energy.\n\nAs for your second question – why measure from the Sun to the Moon? I can’t say I know the full reasoning behind the formula, but it makes sense to me that the Part of Fortune marks the phase relationship between the Sun and Moon. When we speak about lunar phases today, we describe the Moon’s position in relation to the Sun – its distance *from* it – not the distance it has left to travel before rejoining it. We say, for example, that the Moon is in its waxing square from the Sun, not that it has “three squares to go” before reunion. The measurement naturally flows from the Sun as the source to the Moon as the emitter, and that may well be the symbolic logic at work.\n\nYour final point about sect is interesting. I imagin many astrologers will feel it’s natural to reverse the formula according to sect, but is it really? Or has that just become habit through recent custom and practice? I can’t think of any other area of astrology where sect makes us *reverse a calculation* – where we’d say, “in this situation, add; in that situation to obtain *the same point*, subtract”. Usually sect shifts emphasis, rather than invert calculation. So I’d say it feels more consistent to keep the same formula for both, while acknowledging that each has its counterpoint – as the Part of Fortune does with the Part of Spirit. Once we start both reversing and pairing everything, it becomes unnecessarily tangled and, to me, rather unnatural.\n\nAnyway, those are just some casual reflections. I’m not too invested in the debate – in fact, I’ve always felt that the use of too many lots is generally over-extended, and that the planets themselves give us a stronger, more reliable framework. But it’s a worthwhile topic, and I hope we’ll continue it when the new discussion thread opens.",

        "text": "There’s a ton of stark general death symbolism in this chart. A malefic-ruled sign rises, one malefic is on the ASC and co-signifies the sick man, the other malefic - the querent’s significator - is on the 8th cusp of death and disposed by the 8th ruler. The Moon applies tightly to Lord of the 8th, and the 8th house itself is packed. \n\nThere’s also death symbolism more tailored to this story. Mars, the exalted chart ruler’s application to the ASC is testimony for the sick servant causing his own death. The afflicted Moon's applying square to the Sun, the 8th Lord, echoes that, and also signifies a junior person initiating strife with a boss figure (not that I saw that coming).\n\nMercury, as 6th ruler, is a general significator for a servant and is combust, retrograde, has separated from an afflicted Moon and is reversing into grim reaper Saturn. More pointers to death.\n\nA midheaven at a mid-degree of Scorpio with exalted Mars rising promises this is not going to end well. The Mercury-Mars themes suggest illness of the mind and violence - but I never would have guessed how this turned out...",

I was really struck by Ganivet's approach to the chart; he reads it (as far as I can tell) as an event chart about a possible death. Even though the questioner asked about his brother's servant Ganivet makes no attempt to identify the brother or the servant in the chart; its all about a 'death event' and the circumstances surrounding it.\n\nHave to bite my tongue to hold back on the obvious dark humour pun....",

        "text": "I see it as a legitimate horary myself, and Ganivet certainly treats it that way. He’s quite specific about there being two possible approaches – one from the timing of an event, the other from a question – and he does use the word “question” in the Latin. His judgement is framed around a question which was expressed in his text, so it all fits well with our understanding of what a horary fundamentally is.\n\nBut the thing is, when you get trained in judicial astrology technique, the application of them doesn’t lead to a lot of difference, whether you apply them to a horary chart, a consultation chart, a commencement chart, a decumbiture chart, or an event chart. We’re basically using the same approach. With a horary, I don’t think it’s necessary here for him to try to turn the chart to identify the sick man as the servant of the querent’s brother. As Lilly explains in CA, if the question is about life or death for someone, and neither the querent nor their brother are directly involved, there’s no need to span the significations out like that. We can go straight to seeing the chart as immediately relevant for the person it concerns.

At that time Mars was very strong and angular, exactly on the IC - two hours later (around the time of death), the Part of Fortune, the Part of Death, and Saturn were all angular on the Midheaven. The times he gives are too imprecise to use formally, but they did make a lot of sense of the anger and drama, and then the very (let's not say the word) end.",

    "full_content": "A Medieval Horary: Ganivetus’ Sick Man - & October Update\nSkyscript\n2 October\n8\n11\nToday I completed my translation of ‘The Sick Man Horary’ by Ganivetus. Parts of this will be going up on Skyscript, but I’ve included a much fuller piece here for members. This version includes both the Latin and English translation, along with the front matter that leads into the judgement. In this, Ganivetus discusses the signification of disease, sets out some general principles, and then develops his judgement of the illness.\nAlthough I always had a sense that this horary would be fascinating, it wasn’t until I reached the end of it today that I realised how dramatic its conclusion is. I want to give you a trigger warning for that, and advise you to brace yourself. Overall though, I strongly recommend you make time for this – it’s loaded with points of significance, whether your interest is horary, decumbiture, traditional technique, health matters, medieval history, or simply the power of astrological symbolism in action. But be prepared for that ending – it really does come as a shock.\nUpdating the upcoming …\nA couple of days ago I circulated advance details of our next event on the 9th of October. My apologies, that event is changing in theme. There are reasons behind this (not just me being mutable), but the original topic will be rescheduled for later in the programme.\nInstead, Wade Caves will be presenting an important talk on a very pertinent issue. Almost all astrologers make use of the Part of Fortune in some way, yet there’s a sharp split within its doctrine that affects its calculation by night. Why is this, and is it possible to resolve? Wade will be exploring this in a thoughtful, well-researched presentation expected to last about 75 minutes.\nI still need to finish the updated preparations for that talk, so details will be uploaded to the members’ area tomorrow. I’ll also send a reminder with full information early next week.\n\nEnjoy this rather dark medieval horary – it would be best read in the next few hours, as the Moon applies to Mars in Scorpio.\n\nAttachments\nDownload all\nGanivetus_frenzied_man_optimised.pdf\nTags\nGanivetus\nhorary\n11 comments\nLeena Chauhan\n·\n1mo\nThere’s a ton of stark general death symbolism in this chart. A malefic-ruled sign rises, one malefic is on the ASC and co-signifies the sick man, the other malefic - the querent’s significator - is on the 8th cusp of death and disposed by the 8th ruler. The Moon applies tightly to Lord of the 8th, and the 8th house itself is packed. \n\nThere’s also death symbolism more tailored to this story. Mars, the exalted chart ruler’s application to the ASC is testimony for the sick servant causing his own death. The afflicted Moon's applying square to the Sun, the 8th Lord, echoes that, and also signifies a junior person initiating strife with a boss figure (not that I saw that coming).\n\nMercury, as 6th ruler, is a general significator for a servant and is combust, retrograde, has separated from an afflicted Moon and is reversing into grim reaper Saturn. More pointers to death.\n\nA midheaven at a mid-degree of Scorpio with exalted Mars rising promises this is not going to end well. The Mercury-Mars themes suggest illness of the mind and violence - but I never would have guessed how this turned out...\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n1mo\nAgreed, Ganivet recognised the Mercury-Mars themes very well, and saw the intensity and concern in the situation, but I imagine even he was shocked when he learned how it ended.  I think there are interesting testimonied onhow the death was self-inflicted in the end.\n1\nCollapse replies\nJane\n·\n1mo\nThat was a very interesting horary Deb, thanks for it. I was really struck by Ganivet's approach to the chart; he reads it (as far as I can tell) as an event chart about a possible death. Even though the questioner asked about his brother's servant Ganivet makes no attempt to identify the brother or the servant in the chart; its all about a 'death event' and the circumstances surrounding it.\n\nHave to bite my tongue to hold back on the obvious dark humour pun....\n1\n3\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n1mo\nI see it as a legitimate horary myself, and Ganivet certainly treats it that way. He’s quite specific about there being two possible approaches – one from the timing of an event, the other from a question – and he does use the word “question” in the Latin. His judgement is framed around a question which was expressed in his text, so it all fits well with our understanding of what a horary fundamentally is.\n\nBut the thing is, when you get trained in judicial astrology technique, the application of them doesn’t lead to a lot of difference, whether you apply them to a horary chart, a consultation chart, a commencement chart, a decumbiture chart, or an event chart. We’re basically using the same approach. With a horary, I don’t think it’s necessary here for him to try to turn the chart to identify the sick man as the servant of the querent’s brother. As Lilly explains in CA, if the question is about life or death for someone, and neither the querent nor their brother are directly involved, there’s no need to span the significations out like that. We can go straight to seeing the chart as immediately relevant for the person it concerns. This is in line with what Lilly teaches and does – if the matter doesn’t involve an enemy or a relationship where another party plays a central role, we can attach the signification of the person directly to the Ascendant and let the whole chart speak of them.\n\nBTW, for my own interest I did look at charts for around 8 a.m., when the frenzied episode began. At that time Mars was very strong and angular, exactly on the IC - two hours later (around the time of death), the Part of Fortune, the Part of Death, and Saturn were all angular on the Midheaven. The times he gives are too imprecise to use formally, but they did make a lot of sense of the anger and drama, and then the very (let's not say the word) end. \nLoad replies\nGeorgius\n·\n1mo\nVery dramatic.

Vimeo may still store and/or gain access to information on your device, including cookies and local storage.\nEPM Reading Group 1 recording (28 Sep 2025) & extract from Ganivetus\nSkyscript\n30 September\n6\nThanks to everyone who joined the new reading group meeting yesterday, and for those who couldn’t attend at the time, the recording is attached. (It is also linked into the members’ area along with outline details of our next meeting: 8:30 pm UTC Sun 19 Oct 2025)\nGanivet\nWe had several interesting side issues to explore. One point of reference was the astrologer Jean Ganivet (‘Ganivetus’), whose 1431 text Amicus Medicorum (‘Physician’s Friend’) was the source of the first conjunction chart Lilly discusses, dated to 1425. I showed some pages of his Latin text on screen and mentioned that Ganivet was an important source for Lilly’s work generally – according to Lynne Thorndyke his wok was “probably the most influential [medical astrology] treatise composed in Europe during the fifteenth century”. \nBrief biography of Ganivet in the glossary pages on Skyscript (includes link to his Latin text and some other related resources.)\nThe recent horary chart I posted – on whether a sick man would die or recover – is taken from Ganivet’s work, and offers a relatively rare and valuable example of a horary judgement from the late medieval period. I’ll post the full judgement of it within the week (I’m still working on the final parts of the translation). In the meantime, to give more context for the chart itself and the type of material Ganivet covers, I’ve included below the opening section to the chart in Book 3, Chapter 5. When the full translation is complete, I’ll assemble everything, including the original Latin text as well as its translation, into a PDF for members.\n\nUpcoming\nA quick note that our next Skyscript presentation will be on 9th October, when I’ll give a talk on the use of directions in horary – by this I mean compass directions, not primary directions :) I’ll circulate a more pertinent reminder closer to the event.\n\n\n\n━━━━ ✦ ✦ ━━━━━━━━ ✦ ✦ ━━━━\n\nGANIVETUS - AMICUS MEDICORUM (c.1430)\n\nBOOK III  - V\nOn the declaration of the planets influencing various illnesses, and on the knowledge of whether illnesses are curable or not.\nHere follows an account of the planets and of the degrees of the heavens influencing various illnesses. And note that nothing here is said of diseases inflicted by God: of which Sacred Scripture speaks sufficiently, but only of illnesses arising through the course of nature and the celestial influences.\nConcerning these natural infirmities, it must be noted that some bodily illnesses do not always last yet bring pain, such as iliac passion, colic, gout in the feet or hands, and the like; others always last but do not bring pain, such as blindness, deafness, hunchback, mutilation of limbs, and the like; others always last and also bring pain, such as continual fever, acute fever, and similar diseases.\nInfirmities that can be more easily cured, and in a short time, such as acute fevers, are measured by the influence of the Moon. But those which last longer, such as quartan fever, are measured by the motion of the Sun, even if the matter proceeds from Saturn; yet the cure itself and the duration of the cure are measured by the influence of the Sun.\nIt should further be considered that each planet signifies its own particular illnesses according to its inherent nature and influence, and that these illnesses increase, persist, grow, or diminish, according to the signs and degrees, and depending on whether they fall in azimene [lame], bright or dark degrees, or are angular, succedent or cadent. Hence:\nSaturn illnesses are phthisis, catarrh, hectic fever, splenetic disease, dropsy, looseness of the bowels, and more serious disorders such as leprosy, especially elephantiasis, gout, cancer, and the like, and those that chiefly arise from coldness.\nJupiter signifies quinsy, pneumonia, pleurisy, apoplexy, spasm, headache, lethargy, heart disease, and in general all illnesses arising from an excess or corruption of blood, such as synocha [fever arising from excess heat of the blood], synochus [putrid fever from corrupted blood], and similar diseases.\nMars signifies hepatitis, tertian fevers, pestilential fevers, migraine, erysipelas of a choleric nature [St. Anthony’s fire], abortion, suppuration [abscesses], and every illness arising from an excess of choler, which brings about burning and pain, especially those marked by redness.\nThe Sun has influence over rheums affecting the eyes [catarrhal discharges], lesions [or chapping] of the mouth, and over those hot and dry diseases which do not arise from the influence of Mars.\nVenus has influence over cold and moist illnesses, such as soft swellings or abscesses, fistulas, bodily fluids and moist discharges, and excessive fluxes, especially affecting the genitals and the private parts of women.\nMercury has influence over mental disturbances, mania, melancholy, epilepsy, dizziness [vertigo], coughing and an abundance of phlegm.\nThe Moon has influence over paralysis, facial palsies, convulsions [strokes] of the limbs, and ailments arising from obstruction of the nerves.\n\nAnd note that when the lord of the Ascendant, or the Moon, or the Part of Fortune are in an azimene degree, or in dark or pitted degrees, it signifies deep rooted [chronic] illnesses. In bright degrees they are newly arisen [acute]; and their signification is more adverse in Aries, Cancer, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. And sometimes in these signs they signify leprosy, abscesses, pustules, scabies, skin eruptions, and spreading rashes, according to the houses of the figure and the degrees in which the lord of the Ascendant, the Moon, and the Part of Fortune are found.\nAlso consider the Moon in each of the signs; and if the Moon is in Aries with Mars or the Sun there will be illness in the head, a pounding headache, burning fever, anxiety, and difficulty speaking. There may be great pain in the chest and in the lungs, with a most violent pulse, so it is advantageous that the vein of the heart be bled and that cold foods be taken, since there is danger of delirium. And if the Moon is conjoined to malefics, or in a perilous aspect with malefics, there is mortal danger within seven days. For the Moon being with the benefics is favourable and fortunate, but with malefics it is harmful and unfortunate, especially with Mars when the Moon is waxing and Saturn when the Moon is waning. Take note of what has been said.\nRegarding the general influence of planets and degrees over various illnesses, it will be seen in another part of this chapter whether such illnesses are curable or not. And careful judgement is a foremost requirement in this matter: for example, leprosy is said to be incurable because it is cured with difficulty, and rarely, since not every type of leprosy is curable by art but only certain kinds. And the same with many other diseases, each to be considered in its own way and according to the common judgement of physicians, to whom the first determination of such matters belongs. But in turning to specifics and to astrological judgement, many of the matters already explained in this chapter must be borne in mind; and, to the matter at hand, when a case is presented to the astrologer, he must consider whether the illness is curable or not.\nOf this, it should be noted that the astrologer has two ways to commence the inquiry: either through the true onset of the illness, or through a question. The astrologer’s judgement is the same, whether by question or by the onset of the illness; though more truly by the onset, if that can be reliably known.\nAnd to show this a little more clearly, I will give an example from the year of our Lord 1418, 24th day of August, the basis of time being three hours after the meridian with 12 celestial degrees,* on the day of Mercury, hour of Saturn. A certain cleric called John Mortier asked on behalf of his brother’s sick servant, what would be the end of his illness: death or recovery? For which the figure of heaven fell thus over Vienne at the time of the question.\n[*Note – don’t draw the chart for that time, because he later explains that he is using seasonal hours here – I show the chart as it appears in the Latin text and its closest computerised match below - the chart above is an exact reproduction of the original chart presented in modern format. His positions are rounded to the nearest degree, and all planets and house cusps align with modern computation with the exception of the PoD being 1° out and Mars being misplaced by 3° (This is to be expected of historical charts - Mars was always the planet that was the most difficult to place exactly according to historical tables). Overall, its agreement with modern values shows a high level of skill for an astrologer of his era.\n[To be continued ...]\n\nTags\nConjunctions\nEPM\nLilly\nMerlin\nIn collection\nShow more\nRGM\n1 post\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the videos you love from anywhere.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nA Medieval Horary: Ganivetus’ Sick Man - & October Update\nToday I completed my translation of ‘The Sick Man Horary’ by Ganivetus.

It’s a hard question asked at a time of plague: a sick man – signified by the first house – faces a battle of life or death. The astrologer was asked to judge whether he would die or might recover. He gave a decisive answer on the basis that this chart gives clear testimony.\n\nIf you’d like to muse on what you’d make of this yourself, next week I will have my passage finished and polished, and will share the astrologer’s judgement.\n(I’ll be sharing this chart on my Facebook page too, but here on Patreon you’ll receive the full translation of the complete passage once it’s finished.

Obviously, Mars there signals an ‘annoying’ marriage, which Lilly says applies whether it aspects Venus or not. That surely points to reception, Virgo being where Venus is debilitated, so the principle of love, desire and compassion takes a hit. Lilly’s statement that he was unable to shed a tear after the death of his wife of 25 years, leaves us to wonder how much marital strain and ill-will shadowed his most productive years.I'm struck by how often unhappy marriages appear in the lives of historical astrologers. Poor Culpeper eloped with his sweetheart, only for their carriage to be struck by lightning that night, killing her tragically.  J.B.

His overview of Seventh House themes raised some interesting details, and I’m still reflecting on how Lilly’s unhappy love life links to the bad reputation of Mars in Virgo in the seventh. Obviously, Mars there signals an ‘annoying’ marriage, which Lilly says applies whether it aspects Venus or not. That surely points to reception, Virgo being where Venus is debilitated, so the principle of love, desire and compassion takes a hit. Lilly’s statement that he was unable to shed a tear after the death of his wife of 25 years, leaves us to wonder how much marital strain and ill-will shadowed his most productive years.\n\nI'm struck by how often unhappy marriages appear in the lives of historical astrologers. Poor Culpeper eloped with his sweetheart, only for their carriage to be struck by lightning that night, killing her tragically. J.B. Morin was so shocked when his intended died suddenly on the night he was due to propose that he took it as a divine sign (or a sign of a curse) and chose to remain celibate for the rest of his days. By comparison, Lilly didn't do too bad! :)\nThe recording is attached to this post and is also linked into the member’s area, where you can find it alongside our showreel of past presentations:\nhttps://vimeopro.com/stapresenter/latest\n(password: latest)\n\n\n\nComing Up\nOur next member event will be the launch of the new Skyscript Reading Group, centred on William Lilly’s England’s Prophetical Merlin.

Alberto has produced his own modern-English edition of Book 3 of Christian Astrology and will be giving us an overview of the text along with some of the key relationship themes from the Seventh House section. I have already seen glimpses of this and I was bowled over by the beautiful presentation Alberto has put together. The session will be live on Zoom and also be recorded for Skyscript members unable to attend at that time.\n\nEvent Details\nThursday, 18th September 2025\nstarting at – 7 pm UTC ← click this to see the time for you!\nFind the Zoom link at the end of this post - and always prominent in the members area\nAbout our speaker:\nAlberto Forero (Translationoflight.org) is the President of the San Francisco Astrological Society and member of NCGR and ISAR. An astrologer, designer, and YouTuber based in San Francisco, Alberto posts astrological analyses on the Translation of Light channel on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@TranslationofLight) and is working on the Alexandria iBase Project online Astrological Library.\n---\n\n\nA change of focus – and some exciting news\nWe’re making a temporary change of direction for the reading group – one you should find very worthwhile. After making great progress exploring books I & II of Manilius’ Astronomica, we are going to pause that project before resuming with book III next year.\nWhy? Read on …\nAn initiative that’s been developing behind the scenes has reached a stage where it’s timely to share. A small group of us – myself, Josh, Sheila, Morgan, Jane and Michelle – have been working on an annotated and illustrated edition of William Lilly’s England’s Prophetic Merlin. The work is going very well and uncovering some remarkable nuggets of astrological gold.\nAlthough the annotations capture a lot, there is much more to explore than we can fit on the page. Lilly’s text centres on the Saturn-Jupiter Great Conjunction cycles, but behind that main thread lies a rich backdrop of sources and techniques that informed Lilly’s art – material that lets us look more closely at the lives and methods of earlier astrologers who shaped his thinking, while learning the techniques that Lilly used so well.\nWhat’s next?\nTo share this material more openly we’re setting up a new reading group built around our progress with Merlin. This will give us space to open out the ideas, demonstrate and experiment with the practical elements, and work directly with charts connected to the text and its themes. We expect it to be a rich and lively exploration with plenty of new insights for you to take into practice.\nWhat will you get out of this?\nIf you’ve enjoyed the Manilius group, you will definitely enjoy the new theme. We’ll be looking over Lilly’s shoulder and into his life while exploring plenty of charts and delving into other historical avenues that throb with unrecognised significance. Whether your interest is ancient, Renaissance or modern astrology, there’s a lot of great information and practical takeaways to be gained from exploring this text.\nFirst meeting: Sunday 28 September\nThis reading group will be held on Sundays – and our first will start at 8:30 pm UTC on Sunday 28th September. I’ll post more details at the end of next week with early reading material.\nFor now, I’m attaching an article written to introduce the theme and provide a handy overview, which will also feature in the upcoming journal. This is very useful to keep as a reference as it also includes a full table of Saturn-Jupiter conjunctions over 5,000 years.\nAll of us involved in this project are excited at the thought of delving in and exploring it together.\n\nSkyscript - Zoom Link:\n\nhttp://us06web.zoom.us/j/6123333126\nMeeting password = Skyscript\n---------------------------------\nSkyscript Member’s area: https://www.skyscript.co.uk/patron/\nTo enter the page, you will be asked to enter your username and password.\nYour username is your registered email address\nYour password is (all lower case): regio\nAttachments\nDownload all\nSkyscript_Great_Conjunctions.pdf\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more from your favourite creators.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nVimeo\nFor those who missed Wade Caves’ presentation on Fortuna\nFor anyone who wasn’t able to attend Wade’s talk Finding Fortuna on Thursday 9th October, the recording is now available here in this post.\n11 October\n10\n3\nThis video uses Vimeo’s DNT parameter.

The recording is attached to this post and also available in the members’ area showreel of past presentations.\nThis talk will be of particular interest to astrologers drawn to theological issues — especially the controversies that astrology raised in the medieval world. Meira explored in detail how these concerns were vividly debated, focusing especially on medieval Jewish theology, where the work of Jewish practitioners such as Ibn Ezra could be considered highly controversial and even potentially blasphemous.\nUnfortunately, Meira’s connection dropped right at the end, so I didn’t have a chance to thank her properly in the moment — but I hope she knows how much her contribution was valued and appreciated.\nHeads up for our next event:\nOur next presentation will be on Thursday 18 September 2025, when Alberto Forero will be speaking on William Lilly on Marriage Indications in the Nativity. Alberto will give an overview of Book 3 of Christian Astrology (Lilly’s detailed treatment of natal astrology, rarely explored in depth) and illustrate the relationship themes from its section on Seventh House judgments — including how many spouses a person may have, where they will come from, their attractiveness, and the harmony of the relationship, all brought to life with chart examples.\n\n[Check your local time here]\nFinally, the Manilius Reading Group is expected to start up again in September, but for now there’s uncertainty on the exact date.

Garry’s points about the inescapable subjectivity in how we work are very relevant, and it was great to have Robert guiding the discussion with the insight he brings as editor of Correlation. Below are some assets, additions, and follow-up notes linked to topics we touched on during the session.\nHere’s what’s covered in this longer-than-usual recording mailout:\nGiveaway: 3 Annual Subscriptions to Correlation\nFollow-up Links:\nRawlins’ sTARBABY\nAstrological Factors and Dog Behaviour\nWhere I’m Going Next – Gunshots & Firing Squads\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n1) Giveaway: 3 Annual Subscriptions to Correlation\nCorrelation is the Astrological Association’s peer-reviewed journal dedicated to research in astrology. It focuses on peer-reviewed studies that examine astrological claims using empirical methods, including statistical analysis, psychological testing, and historical review. Articles range from original research to reviews and theoretical discussion. It’s a valuable resource for astrologers interested in the relationship between astrology and science, or simply looking to stay informed on developments in astrological research.\nExplore the journal here: https://correlationjournal.com\nThanks to Robert’s support, I have three annual digital subscriptions to Correlation to give away to Skyscript members. If you’d like to be entered into the draw, just comment beneath this post or email me at deb@skyscript.co.uk (be sure to include your Patreon member name). I’ll draw the winners at midnight UTC on Saturday 19 July and announce them the following day.\n2) Follow-up Links\ni) Rawlins’ sTARBABY\nThis is the detailed account of the American astronomer and reputed skeptic Dennis Rawlins, as published in Fate magazine in 1981, which describes his experience as a former member of CSICOP (Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal). It gives a detailed account of how CSICOP mishandled the Gauquelin ‘Mars Effect’ data.\nAccording to Rawlins, CSICOP’s attempt to replicate the Gauquelins’ findings actually confirmed the original result – showing a statistically significant link between Mars’ position and athletic eminence. However, senior members allegedly distorted the methodology and suppressed the outcome in order to preserve the organisation’s sceptical stance. Rawlins resigned and published sTARBABY as an exposé of what he called a serious breach of scientific integrity.\nRead it here: https://www.newdualism.org/papers/D.Rawlins/Starbaby.html\nii) Astrological Factors and Dog Behaviour\nThis is the study Robert mentioned during the meeting – a 2007 paper from the Journal of Scientific Exploration which tested temperament traits in 500 pedigree puppies using astrological data. The study, conducted by Suzel Fuzeau‑Braesch and Jean‑Baptiste Denis, examined whether angular planetary positions correlated with behavioural traits such as dominance, extraversion, and sociability.\nThe results showed statistically significant associations: angular Mars and Jupiter, in particular, were linked to stronger dominance and extraversion. As the subjects were dogs, the study avoided common criticisms about bias in human cultural conditioning.\nRead the study here:\nhttps://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?doi=170986c26a09b16eb1e80f951e6d0489497b7d0d&repid=rep1&type=pdf\n3) Where I’m Going Next – Gunshots and Firing Squads\nI’ve followed Robert’s advice on making use of AI to determine the samples for the next collection in my data project. It will focus on a very specific category of politically motivated gunshot deaths. The cases will be grouped into two sets of 10 charts, distinguishing whether the death was the result of execution or assassination, plus an additional set of 10 charts for notable examples where the birth data is less reliable.\nSet 1: State-Sanctioned Executions / Revolutionary Killings\nDeaths by gunshot carried out under government authority or regime approval during political revolution – cases with timed birth data (Rodden A, B or C)\nSet 2: Political Assassinations (Non-State Sanctioned)\nAssassinations carried out by individuals or groups acting outside official authority – cases with timed birth data (Rodden A, B or C)\nSet 3: Significant Cases with Limited Birth Data\nFamous or culturally significant cases from either category where birth data is missing or unreliable – noon charts used, with time-sensitive techniques removed from analysis\nRobert suggested using AI to eliminate any unconscious personal selection bias in compiling a list of famous and historically significant cases. This sounds easy - but was not without issues! For example, Mata Hari was originally excluded, with AI stating that no reliable birth data existed. I had to point out that her chart carries an AA Rodden rating – at which point the system acknowledged the correction and moved her to the top of the list. It also included many cases that didn’t meet the criteria (such as executions by hanging - or the sybject wasn't even dead -!-), so the output needed a lot of careful filtering. AI isn’t the neutral arbiter we might hope for – its output requires human oversight to ensure relevance and accuracy.\nThe problem I faced wasn’t choosing between many examples – it was identifying enough significant cases to form a group of 10 in each set. It took a lot of work, riddling through AI-generated results, prompting it again and again to correct itself and keep digging deeper.\nThat said, after many hours, the following list was achieved. I now have a very interesting set of charts to work from and I’m looking forward to seeing and sharing what the analysis reveals.\nSet 1 – Executed (or regime-approved death involving gunshot)\nBenito Mussolini – Rodden AA\nChe Guevara – Rodden B\nMata Hari – Rodden AA\nNicolae Ceaușescu – Rodden AA\nClaus von Stauffenberg – Rodden AA\nEdith Cavell – Rodden A\nJosé Rizal – Rodden B\nMaximilian I of Mexico – Rodden AA\nVíctor Jara – Rodden AA\nAugusto César Sandino – Rodden AA\nSet 2 – Assassinated\nJohn F.

Upcoming Events\nFinally, an early heads-up about our next speaker event – a welcome return from Meira Epstein, offering us another chance to glean insights from expertise on the work of Ibn Ezra. Outline details in the graphic below, with full information to follow closer to the date.\nAlso, I’m currently liaising with Mireille to confirm the start date for the recommencement of the Manilius Reading Group. It’s tentatively set for 25th September, but we need to double-check a couple of details, so I’ll confirm that more securely soon.\n\nUntil next time,\nDeb 🌟\n6 comments\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n4mo\nI got you in Doug.

I want to apologise for the fact that I have been so busy creating, researching and coding over the last several months that I have barely managed to keep up with day-to-day correspondence, leaving me no extra time to keep you informed on all the many developments and additions that have been, and still are being made to Skyscript and its associated resources.  There is a lot of valuable work for me to update you on, and I hope to break through a barrier soon where I can find more time to share news more often and point you to all the new material that is coming through. \nBut for now, staying on the topic of Manilius: I have yet to determine the date of the next Manilius Reading Group meeting, which will begin exploring the text of Book III using the 1977 translation of G. P. Goold.  Goold’s text is still under copyright, but we have obtained permission for the use of his translation of Book III only for our project. I will set the date for the next meeting once I have created shareable handouts for that.\nAlso, in the last meeting, there was some interesting discussion about how the arrangement of house themes reflected ancient Egyptian thoughts on the passage of the soul – and I thought this follow-up link might be of interest for anyone who wanted to delve into that.\n\nFinally, a heads-up for our next Skyscript presentation meeting, delivered by Frank Clifford on the use of the consultation chart:\nFriday, 6 June 2025\nStarting at - 7pm UTC ← click this Time and Date link to check the time in your locality.\nAbout our speaker\nFrank Clifford has built an eclectic, 35-year career as the writer of a dozen books, a consultant astrologer and palmist, a publisher/editor, a researcher of birth data, and the Principal of the London School of Astrology, which has branches in China and Japan.

To me, the Jonesers were the coolest cohort ever - tough, smart, cool, funny, sexy, free. The Boomers were too arrogant and self-righteous and cringe -- and we Xers were a bit too fractured by broken families and diminishing opportunities -- but the GJs really benefited from that Cindarella-zone sweet-spot. \n\nSo once this heatwave breaks, bust out the grill and the chaise and let these glorious bursts of life and noise fill your soul and fuel your spirit.\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/6a0oU2xyev8oz0qit8ReHb?si=hJKwo60ZSoGKLHe34gcEkA&pi=Cs1pUubJQGeU8",

        "text": "Quite a lot comes to mind after listening to this informative lecture on the topic I've followed with some interest over the years. \n-- It is always fascinating to observe how generation X always remains invisible and always get a thorough lashing by the baby boomers.\n-- Over the years I've been highly intrigued to observe that demographers of generations have been compelled to make a special carve out for people born around 1960-65, the time when I was born. I first heard this group described as the \"wedgy\" generation. More recently, I heard a more complementary  description calling this cohort the \"Joneses\" generation, this referring to both Jim Jones, and the idea of keeping up with the Joneses. The idea here is that this \"Jones\" group benefited from some of the wealth of the baby boomers while simultaneously being subjected to the growing scarcity of resources, forcing them to begin competing on a level not seen before (Jupiter/Saturn--Capricorn) 1961.\n--  Carl Jung once remarked on the fact that one generation lives in the shadow of their parents and must subsequently be forced to compensate for their actual or perceived failings. This explains why they so often don't get on well with their parents, but also explains why we do get on so well with our grandparents. this is of course,  more true of the baby boomer generation and generation X, who were not exactly known to be best friends with their parents as some of the more recent generations are...",

As one of the Joneses (I've never heard that before but prefer it to 'wedgy'), I had already wondered whether there might be some kind of 'cuspal' effect, because the BB bracket seems too wide for a period where life changed so dramatically - huge difference in life conditioning for parents giving birth at the end of the 1940s to those in the early 1960s.",

There’s a lot to unpack in this exploration. \n\nThanks to Joy for sharing another way astrology can shine a light on meaning.  \n\nJust this week i received my copy of Renn Butler’s ‘The Archetypal Universe’ and made my notes from Joy’s Generation talk in it. \n\nEarly in the talk, I intuitively sensed the Generational vibe driving inner compass forces. They may have qualities and frequencies similarity to themes/programming similar to a miasm that are there for us to grow thru and with. \n\n“Homeopaths view miasms as underlying predispositions or chronic conditions that can manifest as various symptoms…”\n\nLike the attendees pointed out, its not a cut/dry label that applies to the Generation. Although, we might notice that certain transits Trigger Generational groups within it  shifting their consciousness to action collectively in a certain way. \n\nI’m excited to let the info sink in and mature. ✨",

The Boomers were too arrogant and self-righteous and cringe -- and we Xers were a bit too fractured by broken families and diminishing opportunities -- but the GJs really benefited from that Cindarella-zone sweet-spot. \n\nSo once this heatwave breaks, bust out the grill and the chaise and let these glorious bursts of life and noise fill your soul and fuel your spirit.\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/6a0oU2xyev8oz0qit8ReHb?si=hJKwo60ZSoGKLHe34gcEkA&pi=Cs1pUubJQGeU8\n1\nKarl Skellenger\n·\n7mo\nQuite a lot comes to mind after listening to this informative lecture on the topic I've followed with some interest over the years. \n-- It is always fascinating to observe how generation X always remains invisible and always get a thorough lashing by the baby boomers.\n-- Over the years I've been highly intrigued to observe that demographers of generations have been compelled to make a special carve out for people born around 1960-65, the time when I was born. I first heard this group described as the \"wedgy\" generation. More recently, I heard a more complementary  description calling this cohort the \"Joneses\" generation, this referring to both Jim Jones, and the idea of keeping up with the Joneses. The idea here is that this \"Jones\" group benefited from some of the wealth of the baby boomers while simultaneously being subjected to the growing scarcity of resources, forcing them to begin competing on a level not seen before (Jupiter/Saturn--Capricorn) 1961.\n--  Carl Jung once remarked on the fact that one generation lives in the shadow of their parents and must subsequently be forced to compensate for their actual or perceived failings. This explains why they so often don't get on well with their parents, but also explains why we do get on so well with our grandparents. this is of course,  more true of the baby boomer generation and generation X, who were not exactly known to be best friends with their parents as some of the more recent generations are...\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n7mo\nThat makes sense to me. As one of the Joneses (I've never heard that before but prefer it to 'wedgy'), I had already wondered whether there might be some kind of 'cuspal' effect, because the BB bracket seems too wide for a period where life changed so dramatically - huge difference in life conditioning for parents giving birth at the end of the 1940s to those in the early 1960s.\n1\nCollapse replies\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n7mo\nTo those interested in getting a copy of the slides used in Joy Usher's presentation: she has provided them as a PDF file today, and I have added the attachment to the Patreon post with her video embedded - or you can download a copy on this link: https://www.skyscript.co.uk/pdf/skyscript_ages_usher.pdf\n1\nKerryleegh\n·\n7mo\nWow! There’s a lot to unpack in this exploration. \n\nThanks to Joy for sharing another way astrology can shine a light on meaning.  \n\nJust this week i received my copy of Renn Butler’s ‘The Archetypal Universe’ and made my notes from Joy’s Generation talk in it. \n\nEarly in the talk, I intuitively sensed the Generational vibe driving inner compass forces. They may have qualities and frequencies similarity to themes/programming similar to a miasm that are there for us to grow thru and with. \n\n“Homeopaths view miasms as underlying predispositions or chronic conditions that can manifest as various symptoms…”\n\nLike the attendees pointed out, its not a cut/dry label that applies to the Generation. Although, we might notice that certain transits Trigger Generational groups within it  shifting their consciousness to action collectively in a certain way. \n\nI’m excited to let the info sink in and mature. ✨\n2\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n7mo\nGlad you enjoyed it Kerryleegh :)\nCollapse replies\n\n\n\nWatch the videos you love from anywhere.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nVimeo\nEPM Reading Group 1 recording (28 Sep 2025) & extract from Ganivetus\nThanks to everyone who joined the new reading group meeting yesterday, and for those who couldn’t attend at the time, the recording is attac\n30 September\n6\n0\nThis video uses Vimeo’s DNT parameter.

I love how, at that point, Quigley felt a sense of duty to astrology as well as to her own reputation to speak up about the true nature of her services to the President, and in turn the nation. As Josh notes, Quigley was a committed Republican. As an Arian, I guess she wasn’t going to take being airbrushed as a kindly friend-counsellor lying down! I recall hearing that Quigley used to cast all her charts by hand as software wasn’t yet available. She would have needed all her martial energy to keep up with the multiple scheduling requests made of her. Kudos to Joan.\n\nStill, it was saddening if unsurprising to watch the gulf between Quigley and the TV interviewer as to the ’seriousness’ of her work. Given the level, depth and volume she worked at, and her own sense of purpose, she can be forgiven for finding unfathomable anyone questioning the importance of her work. I appreciated the video clip being included to 'feel the energy' of someone who is now a historical figure in astrology.\n\nI love how, as a self-avowed astrologer with technical chops, Quigley also confidently followed her own intuition e.g. electing a trine to undo Carter in the first Carter-Reagan debate. The Aries does what wins the battle. Emplacing Gorbachev’s significator in ‘Ronnie’s’ first house for the Geneva Summit also reminded me how sticking to reliable, basic principles creates sound elections. Arian uncomplicated clarity.\n\nNow I want to read ‘What Would Joan Say?’!",

After Icarius was stoned to death by shepherds who became intoxicated on the wine he kindly gave them, his body was hidden under a tree. Erigone’s faithful dog, Maira, found his body and grief-struck Erigone cursed the city before hanging herself from the same tree. Then Maira jumped into a well and drowned. Infuriated Dionysus placed the Maiden in heaven to commemorate her piety, along with Icarius in the stars of Boötes and Maira in Canis Major, then inflicted Athens with a terrible drought. Erigone’s curse resulted in a widespread spate of other Athenian maidens killing themselves in the same manner as Erigone. The wrath of Dionysus was only appeased when the Athenians introduced an annual festival to honour the dead – dedicated to Erigone and called theAeora(the Swing) it involved hanging icons and offerings from trees, sacrificing fruit, and young women ritualistically swinging on trees in sympathy with the suicidal maidens. (In view of this myth, it is interesting to note that a 2003 statistical survey by E. Salib of the University of Liverpool established a significantly increased distribution of suicide by hanging by those born when the Sun is in Virgo (details:pubmed.nci.nih.gov).The reference to justice Manilius makes portrays a more general theme of Virgo symbolism, as depicted in the description of Virgo recorded by Aratus (98ff.):"

Infuriated Dionysus placed the Maiden in heaven to commemorate her piety, along with Icarius in the stars of Boötes and Maira in Canis Major, then inflicted Athens with a terrible drought. Erigone’s curse resulted in a widespread spate of other Athenian maidens killing themselves in the same manner as Erigone. The wrath of Dionysus was only appeased when the Athenians introduced an annual festival to honour the dead – dedicated to Erigone and called theAeora(the Swing) it involved hanging icons and offerings from trees, sacrificing fruit, and young women ritualistically swinging on trees in sympathy with the suicidal maidens. (In view of this myth, it is interesting to note that a 2003 statistical survey by E. Salib of the University of Liverpool established a significantly increased distribution of suicide by hanging by those born when the Sun is in Virgo (details:pubmed.nci.nih.gov).The reference to justice Manilius makes portrays a more general theme of Virgo symbolism, as depicted in the description of Virgo recorded by Aratus (98ff.):"

I realised that Goold treats that particular point with more clarity than Garrod, so I have changed the annotated handout pages to draw from him and added in an extra diagram – the revised pages for last nights reading are attached to this post.\n(I believe the purpose of that comment is only to say that the quadruplicity groups divide the circle of the zodiac into four but do not relate to the rules that quarter the celestial sphere into the four cardinal points.)\nErigone\nSome mention was made last night to the labelling of Virgo as Erigone.  Since our meeting was held as the Moon moved into its eclipse, we enjoyed recalling the tragic story of Erigone (and her dad and her dog).  I promised to find the bit where it had been previously discussed and mention it here. \nManilius usually refers to Virgo by the name of Erigone, and it is in his second book, line 31 (Goold 85/ Garrod 3) where he says that this constellation honours her “for her filial affection (Goold) / justice (Garrod).  Here is the annotation I added to that point:\nMyth records Erigone to be the daughter of Icarius (Ikarios), a devotee of Dionysus in Athens. After Icarius was stoned to death by shepherds who became intoxicated on the wine he kindly gave them, his body was hidden under a tree. Erigone’s faithful dog, Maira, found his body and grief-struck Erigone cursed the city before hanging herself from the same tree. Then Maira jumped into a well and drowned. Infuriated Dionysus placed the Maiden in heaven to commemorate her piety, along with Icarius in the stars of Boötes and Maira in Canis Major, then inflicted Athens with a terrible drought. Erigone’s curse resulted in a widespread spate of other Athenian maidens killing themselves in the same manner as Erigone. The wrath of Dionysus was only appeased when the Athenians introduced an annual festival to honour the dead – dedicated to Erigone and called the Aeora (the Swing) it involved hanging icons and offerings from trees, sacrificing fruit, and young women ritualistically swinging on trees in sympathy with the suicidal maidens. (In view of this myth, it is interesting to note that a 2003 statistical survey by E. Salib of the University of Liverpool established a significantly increased distribution of suicide by hanging by those born when the Sun is in Virgo (details: pubmed.nci.nih.gov).\nThe reference to justice Manilius makes portrays a more general theme of Virgo symbolism, as depicted in the description of Virgo recorded by Aratus (98 ff.):\nBeneath both feet of Boötes mark the Maiden, who in her hands bears the gleaming Ear of Corn … Her men called Justice; but she assembling the elders, it might be in the market-place or in the wide-wayed streets, uttered her voice, ever urging on them judgements kinder to the people.\nWe had an intersting discussion of this point in our Meeting 10 last year (direct link  | password Garrod) - we begin discussing the issue of Erigone 10 minutes into that recording.\nOur next Manilius Reading Group meeting will be:\nThursday, 17 April 2025\nstarting at - 7:30 pm UTC ← click this Time and Date link to check the time in your locality.\n\nOur Zoom link:\nhttp://us06web.zoom.us/j/6123333126\nMeeting password = Skyscript\nIn the next meeting, we pick up the text of book II, starting at line 693 (Garrod p.43 / Goold p.137) which introduces the theory of dodecatemories (12-fold sign divisions) before moving on to the topic of angles and house division.\nAttachments\nDownload all\nManilius_II_27-31.pdf\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the videos you love from anywhere.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nLocked\nManilius reading group - recording 2\nFor those who missed and want to catch up, here is the recording of last night's Manilius Reading Group.

        "text": "Thank you so much for this presentation ! :) Just a quick thought: In Greek Orthodoxy, the number 40 is a big deal because it marks moments of transition and change. You see it everywhere: Christ fasted for 40 days before starting his ministry, the Great Flood lasted 40 days, Moses spent 40 days on Mount Sinai, and after his resurrection, Christ stayed on Earth for 40 days before ascending to Heaven.\n\nThis idea carries over into everyday Orthodox traditions. When a baby is born, they aren’t brought to church right away. Instead, they’re welcomed on the 40th day in a blessing called Sarantismos, just like Christ was presented at the temple. When someone passes away, their family holds a memorial service on the 40th day because it’s believed that the soul goes through a journey before reaching its resting place. Even fasting periods, like Lent, last 40 days; it’s seen as the right amount of time to prepare for something important.",

It has a lot of the usual awful things from arabic medieval astrological magic but it makes use of the names of God in planetary invocations and may help clarify some of the connections\" - The Sun of Knowledge (Shams al-Ma'arif): An Arabic Grimoire in Selected Translation - AMAZON\nThank you Simão!\nUpcoming:\nNext Thursday (13th March - gosh ... already ...) we will meet again to resume the reading of Manilius.

Joy Usher will be talking about identifying the astrological signatures of generational influences – more details will follow on this next week (after the Manilius meeting).\n\nThank you Baris and everyone who turned up live today - I always get great pleasure from reconnecting at these events.\nHave a great Sunday!\nDeb\n4 comments\nTheodora Vasilopoulou\n·\n8mo\nThank you so much for this presentation ! :) Just a quick thought: In Greek Orthodoxy, the number 40 is a big deal because it marks moments of transition and change. You see it everywhere: Christ fasted for 40 days before starting his ministry, the Great Flood lasted 40 days, Moses spent 40 days on Mount Sinai, and after his resurrection, Christ stayed on Earth for 40 days before ascending to Heaven.\n\nThis idea carries over into everyday Orthodox traditions. When a baby is born, they aren’t brought to church right away. Instead, they’re welcomed on the 40th day in a blessing called Sarantismos, just like Christ was presented at the temple. When someone passes away, their family holds a memorial service on the 40th day because it’s believed that the soul goes through a journey before reaching its resting place. Even fasting periods, like Lent, last 40 days; it’s seen as the right amount of time to prepare for something important.\n2\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n8mo\nVery interesting additional info - thanks Theodora\nCollapse replies\nKarl Skellenger\n·\n8mo\nThank-you, I very much enjoyed this presentation.

(I believe there is, BTW – I also believe that falling trees make sounds, even if no one hears them)\nGarry’s presentation was an extremely interesting catalyst for stirring ideas and taking this conversation further. We only had limited time for follow-up discussion last Thursday so I propose that we revisit this theme in a few months, next time purely as a panel discussion with group interaction, building on the expectation that participants will have watched Garry’s talk already and had some time to digest and reflect on the issues raised.\nI have already floated this idea with Garry, and he is up for it. I expect to put this on the calendar during the summer, so stay tuned for more news on that – and let me know if you want to participate directly with an angle to add.\n\nLet me add here some of the links placed in the chat to resources mentioned during Garry's talk:\nhttps://cosmocritic.com - the website maintained by Garry and Kirk Little which features rare and significant texts about astrology – what it is, how it works and how to evaluate it\nhttps://www.skyscript.co.uk/rev_nasser.html - Kirk Little’s review of Under One Sky  by Rafael Nasser, published in 2004\nhttps://karlskellenger.substack.com/p/men-at-war-under-the-dark-sun-of - recent article by Karl Skellenger on significance of the 17th degree & Neptune ingress into Aries\n\n\nImportant notice on upcoming talks:\nAs mentioned in the meeting, the next Manilius Reading Group meeting is being pushed back a couple of weeks to allow that meeting date – 27th February – to be used for a Mundane Matters discussion instead.  In this we will look at the upcoming eclipse, and some relevant nativities/mundane themes that impact the peace prospects for Israel and surrounding nations.\nTo clarify, the details of our upcoming events are as follows (I’ll circulate reminders for each event one week in advance):\nFeb 27  (Thurs) - 8:00 pm UTC - Mundame Matters (current events, open discussion) - focus on upcoming eclipse & Israel\nMar 9 (Sun) - 11:00 am UTC   - How Sufis dance with Saturn and Mars with Baris Ilhan\nMar 13 (Thurs) - 8:00 pm UTC - Reading MANILIUS: Astronomica, book II\nBe sure to note the Sunday presentation on 9th March, delivered by top international astrologer Baris Ilhan, who will share insights from her unique research and expertise.\nAlso note that bookings are being take now for the InMundo World Astrology Summit hosted by Wade Caves. This is not a free event, but there is a discounted price of $85 available to you as a Skyscript Patreon for the full 2-day  program.\n\n\n\nMUNDANE resources on Skyscript\nI’ll close by letting you know that the Mundane Matters Skyscript page is back online now with many improvements: \n\nhttps://www.skyscript.co.uk/mm.html  \n\nI mentioned the scripting developments in progress for this page – they are still ongoing so not fully implemented yet. I'm not ready to promote the page publicly but giving you a heads up because the interim page is still bursting with useful mundane charts that are easily cross-referenced with each other. (This has been my life of late – I have added a *lot* of new charts ... charts ... tables ... diagrams ..., with a lot more currently ‘in process’).\n\nCheck out the improvements in the Skyscript Eclipse section too, because oodles of work have been poured into that. It now includes visuals of eclipse charts through to 2030 along with easy-to-access tables of eclipse degrees that range from 1500-2500 AD. I have the full set of lunation charts preprepared as chart visuals too, through to 2030 - they are preprogrammed to appear on site at the appropriate time and when I have a little more time I will put them together in a booklet to distribute to members.\nhttps://www.skyscript.co.uk/eclipse.html\n\nBTW, here is the chart for the timing of the Peace agreement between Israel and Hamas - one of the charts we can consider together in our upcoming Mundame Matters meeting on the 27th.\n\n\n\n\nIt was lovely to connect with everyone as we listened to Garry.\nPeace be with you.\nHave a great weekend\nDeb\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the videos you love from anywhere.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nVimeo\nHow Sufis Dance with Saturn and Mars - Baris Ilhan (09/03/25)\nThe recording is attached for the delightful and thoughtful presentation Baris Ilhan gave us today on Sufi philosophy and Al-Tusi’s views on\n9 March\n4\n4\nThis video uses Vimeo’s DNT parameter.

This is correct because the reflection of a degree across the equinoctial axis lies opposite to that which reflects across the tropical axis. ...Antiscion gives us instead a notion of 'likeness'[17] based upon the similarity of the degree of the zodiac as it relates to rising times and the equality of days and nights. In contra-antiscia, it is based upon an inverse reflection because the days of one are mirrored by the night of the other. With antiscion a more immediately equivalent factor is involved; with contra-antiscion it is an opposing principle so the relationship is more difficult or antipathetic. These philosophical principles tally with William Lilly's assessment:\"as there are antiscia, which of the good planets we think are equal to a sextile or trine, so there are contra-antiscions, which we find to be of the nature of a square or opposition\".[18]"

This is p.119 of the Loeb Goold translation, although we are following the H.W. Garrod English translation, where this text is on p.29.\nI have been working through the text before the meeting, so our annotated/illustration edition now goes up to II.535. You can view/download the whole of book II, with the new pages, on this link: https://skyscript.co.uk/pdf/pubs/texts/manilius/Garrod_II/#page=23\nOr download the new pages only in the attached PDF file. I recommend you have a copy of those pages handy, as the diagrams help to make sense of the text.\n\n(We may read beyond the pages I have annotated in our meeting tonight, in which case we will read directly from Garrod's original text). I hoped to get more 'ahead', but ... art is long and computer challenges have been many. This particular passage also took me down some cavernous research detours, which helped me make sense of several vague details that have been needling me for years - largely, about the origins of antiscia and how these are presented in Ptolemy's work ... this isn't the kind of material that can be easily rushed.)\n\nAttachments\nDownload all\nManilius_22-25.pdf\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more from your favourite creators.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nManilius Reading Group: 8pm UTC Thursday 13th March\nQuick reminder that we meet again tomorrow for our next Manilius Reading Group meeting.

The meeting begins on Friday, 17th January, at 8pm UTC. \nWe are picking up the text in Book II, from line 453. This is p.119 of the Loeb Goold translation, although we are following the H.W. Garrod English translation, available on this link: https://www.skyscript.co.uk/pdf/pubs/texts/manilius/garrod/index.html#page=126\nOur passage starts “Learn now how the parts of the human body are distributed among the signs …”.\nThe text goes on to describe relationships between the signs based on parallel associations rather than aspectual configurations (summarised in the attached diagram, which should make sense after our meeting). These create the audentia  -- signs of ‘hearing’; videntia ‘seeing’; amantia ‘loving’ and aversa ‘loathing’. There’s some interesting points about non-reciprocated affections here: as a Taurean married to an Aries, I smile at the thought that the Ram “loves the Bull with a baffled love” while the Bull “weaves guile for the Ram” -- hah, so true :)\nI am still working on illustrations and annotations for this passage, and hope to our annotated edition updated and circulated here before the meeting – but I know it will be tight, so I won’t delay any longer in sending out this reminder.\nHere’s the essential info again:\nManilius Reading Group (continuing Book II)\nFriday, 17 January 2024\nstarting at - 8 pm UTC ← click this to see the time for you!\n\nOur Zoom link:\nhttp://us06web.zoom.us/j/6123333126\nMeeting password = Skyscript\n If anyone wants to review any of the previous sessions, all have been recorded and can be watched on this link, which also has links to various Manilius reading resources. \nhttps://vimeopro.com/stapresenter/manilius \nTo enter - add password: Garrod\n Have a good week and hope to see you Friday!\n1 comment\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n10mo\nThank you so much ☺️ \n\n\n\n\n\nRead more from your favourite creators.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nManilius Reading Group - today, 8pm UTC\nA final reminder that we meet today for our next: Manilius Reading Group (continuing Book II) Friday, 17 January 2024 starting at - 8 pm UTC\n17 January\n0\n0\nManilius Reading Group: 8pm UTC Thursday 13th March\nQuick reminder that we meet again tomorrow for our next Manilius Reading Group meeting.

It shows the arrangement of gods described by Manilius, but with a curious displacement which moves the depictions of the zodiac signs and gods one month away from what we might expect. This is explained by the pillar showing the zodiac sign that is prevalent that month, rather than the one that makes the ingress that month, yet retaining the god of the ingressed sign.For example, the month of October is associated with Libra on the pillar, the sign that prevails that month, not September, which is when the Sun enters Libra. However, the associated tutelary god is Mars - which is correct for Scorpio, which the Sun ingresses in October, but not for Libra. So there is a relatable logic that ties the schemes together, but this gives evidence that the priority arrangement is based on these gods being guardians of months of the year, which pick up the zodiac association as a consequence.Image sources:I've created a forum post with full details of sources and extra information - unfortunately, most of you cannot see it yet, because I am still settung up the member's only forum, but you will be able to very soon.

It is also linked into the member area (https://www.skyscript.co.uk/patron) \nOr – you can watch any of the 6 latest talks and meeting recordings on this link –\nhttps://vimeopro.com/stapresenter/latest\n - add the following password:  latest\n Please note (!)\nOur next mundane matters meeting has been pushed back a week to Oct 24 2024 Thurs 7:00 pm UTC. This is a necessary change as something has come up for me next Wednesday that I cannot reschedule. (I will circulate fuller details next week).\nA few of you were asking about the Zoom link for the presentation tonight.  As a reminder, the Zoom link is the same for every meeting, and the details are always displayed at the top of the member area:\n\nSkyscript Zoom link: http://us06web.zoom.us/j/6123333126\n- add the password (Skyscript).\nBut I should have included the details in the reminders I circulated here through Patreon, too — that was my oversight, and I apologise.  I am currently stretched in too many directions trying to set up the new member area. I am sure that everything will run more efficiently when I am over that hurdle, and It will lighten my load when I don’t need to replicate posts through Skyscript and here on Patreon, too. (I see myself ‘making the best of things’ for the rest of this year, but with high hopes that next year will get everything safely back on smoother tracks).\nNext month, our guest presenter will be Meira Epstein, who will give a talk about Ibn Ezra & the Jewish Tradition in Astrology. This will be a Sunday event, and it will start at 6pm UTC  on November 10th - (again, I will circulate a reminder with full details a week before the event).\n\nThanks to everyone who attended today and added your energies (and your well-considered viewpoints) into the meeting!\n\nDeb\n    1 comment\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n1y\nSad to miss the live event - this month is turning into a marathon of activity for me 🤣 looking fwd to the recording x thanks for it all Deb 🙏\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the videos you love from anywhere.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nVimeo\nRecording: England’s Prophetical Merlin Reading Group 2 (from 19 Oct 2025)\nThe recording is attached for yesterday’s EPM reading group.

The last couple of weeks have been everything September’s eclipsed lunation conjunct Neptune on Scheat promised, haven't they?  The weather in the UK is generally mild and temperate, but even here, we have been having record levels of rainfall and many problems caused by floods.\n(I am fine, myself, BTW; just being a typical Brit and moaning about the dismal weather.)\n\nBut … one bright light in this week is that we will be resuming the Manilius Reading Group this Thursday!  We are picking up from Book II.150, just at the point where we finally get to explore the details of astrological technique.\n Here are the details: \nManilius Reading Group 11 – continuing Book II 150ff.\nDate of Meeting: Thursday, 3rd October 2024\nStart time: 8:30 pm UTC ( check all local times on this link)\nDuration: ≈ 75 mins\nSkyscript Zoom link: http://us06web.zoom.us/j/6123333126\nZoom password: Skyscript \n  We are working from the English translation of H.W.

(If you are mildly curious and have never attended our Reading Group before, pop along ... this is a very friendly group and you will be made very welcome).\n\nI will be recording the meetings for those who want to follow along in their own time \nDeb\nAttachments\nDownload all\nManilius_II_working.pdf\n6 comments\nKarl Skellenger\n·\n1y\nThank-you!\nKarl Skellenger\n·\n1y\nHello, Hope you are finally getting some sunshine in your part of the world.

I thought it would be captured in the recording, but that didn’t happen, because when I was looking at the poll it wasn’t my screen that was being shared (duh! - I’ll know for next time).\nThe poll asked attendees to choose – based only on astrological reasoning – whether Harris or Trump is more likely to win the election.  73% judged Kamala Harris is more likely to win.  However, last night’s meeting made it abundantly clear that the astrological signatures of this election are very dramatic and volatile. So we ended up deciding it is all still a ‘cliff-hanger’ (and being happy that these folks are not our own clients).\n I have attached some follow-up assets to this post\nThis is a link to Karl Skellenger’s ‘Anteros Astrology’ blog post on how the introduction of televised debate shifted the dynamics of US elections.

    "full_content": "Re: your Skyscript subscription\nSkyscript\n28 Aug 2024\n12\n7\n\nAs many of you already know, one of my main priorities this year is to move the Skyscript membership scheme away from Patreon. This will provide a more integrated and streamlined experience, as all membership functions will be housed fully on the Skyscript site. You will have an individual login that works across the whole site. Instead of messages and updates being placed here on Patreon, there will be a dedicated area in the Skyscript forum that is only visible to members.  We will have improved facilities to provide news and notices and to continue focused discussion as a follow-up to Skyscript talks and events. You will also have more control over what you receive or choose not to receive and a better ability to share charts, graphics, assets and discussions with each other.\n\nThis migration will provide many long-term benefits — for you as a member and for the development of future Skyscript content and assets so that, next year, I can be more focused on arranging a legacy plan for the site. I am still awaiting technical information on how this will be managed on the server side. I have been informed today that everything is going well. We are in the beta-testing stage now, and the final ‘go-ahead’ to proceed with the plan should come through this weekend. Since I will be away at the AA conference for the next few days, I will give you a loose overview now of how this plan is expected to work.\n\nRegardless of your tier, your membership payment will be suspended initially, and your membership period will be extended by four months.\nThis is to thank you for your patience as the production of the Skyscript newsletter has been seriously impeded this year. This grace period will allow me to get back on track without feeling too anxious about missed deadlines. (I had optimistically hoped to complete the next newsletter by the end of this month, but too many emergency problems have occurred in other areas that sucked up all my available time – my realistic target now is to coincide with the Libra ingress).\nSince Mind-level subscribers have been deprived of most of their expected content, from now until the end of the year all scheduled talks and presentations are available to all members regardless of your membership tier. (This includes everything except the soul-level meetings).\n\nThe payment suspension will start in September 2024. (Most of you will make your final payment on September 1st this year.)\nThis suspension won't affect your access to the membership area or any posts here on Patreon.  I will still be using Patreon to circulate messages for a while, and you can still interact with posts as you always have.  The payment is being suspended, not the service.\nHere is what it means in practical terms:\n·      If you pay monthly – after 1st September, you will not be charged for the rest of this year.\n·      If you pay annually – your pre-paid subscription period will be extended by four months.\n\nI will also review membership prices once the subscription resumes to provide more for less. I don’t have the full details of prices at this time, but I am committed to bringing base prices down. There will also be an immediate additional benefit from the fact that the VAT currently charged on your subscription by Patreon will not be applicable once we move away from their site.\nI am sure you will have questions, but be aware that I will be off social media and messaging sites (including this one) until I find my feet again after the conference. I will keep you informed as much as I can, but there is much to be done, so please bear with me as I try to keep my balance on what feels like a spinning dance floor!\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI have two other astro-notices to share:\n Firstly, some sad news. Kirk Little informed me yesterday that Geoffrey Cornelius passed away on Monday this week (26 August). He was diagnosed with Cancer in May this year.  Although his death was not unexpected, it still brings a great feeling of loss to our community. Those of us who knew him will have fond memories of an extremely wise, yet remarkably humble man. I genuinely think Geoffrey was one of the most impressive presenters I have ever had the pleasure of listening to at a conference, and only recently (in Dorian Greenbaum’s recent talk) we were all agreeing how his book ‘The Moment of Astrology’ is one of the most important books on astrology published in our generation. \nGeoffrey was the partner of astrologer Maggie Hyde, who will be devastated at his passing, so please hold her in your thoughts.\nSecondly, some happier news for those who like to calculate charts on Apple platforms. Last year we covered news about Roger Pearson’s development of Astro-Connexions for iPads.  This is a very economical yet excellent astrology app, loaded with useful features. Further development means it is now available on all Apple platforms: iPad, Mac AND iPhone. It includes the ability to calculate Primary Directions, too, which is a first for the iPhone, as far as I’m aware.\nIf that sounds of interest – check out Roger’s website for the app at\n https://astroconnexions.com\n\n\nThat's all for now. I am back to working on PowerPoints and looking forward to seeing some of you this weekend in Leicester!\n\n\n7 comments\nKealoha Cristiano\n·\n1y\nAloha Deb and STA team,\nSupporting you guys all the way.\nSending you waves of Aloha,\n1\nBill Sheeran\n·\n1y\nThanks Deb for letting us know the sad news about Geoffrey Cornelius.

The talk opens up issues that effect us all and to which there are no easy answers, but there seemed to be a summary consensus that – as a community – we need to be wary of vocabulary used and setting out realistic expectations that we make relevant observations on patterns that can lead to reliable predictions, but we are not necessarily claiming knowledge of distant  future events before they happen.\n  PS – keep your eye out for an important message that I will be circulating next  week. This will explain why the newsletter has been so delayed and what I intend to do to recompense and thank you for your valuable support despite of this.  (Essentially, expect your membership period to be extended for a lengthy free period starting next month – I’ll give more details next week on how this will work and how your payments will be halted, or your pre-paid membership extended – after I have some final details checked out for my own undertstanding).\n8 comments\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n1y\nFinally caught up with the talk and what an important moment it was.

I won't type it out as it's a long piece of text, but essentially Elwell questions the whole concept of 'prediction' and suggests that what astrologers really do, if they are honest, is a balance of probabilities based on astrological symbolism - he calls this 'intelligent anticipation'.\n4\nWatch the videos you love from anywhere.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nVimeo\nEPM Reading Group 1 recording (28 Sep 2025) & extract from Ganivetus\nThanks to everyone who joined the new reading group meeting yesterday, and for those who couldn’t attend at the time, the recording is attac\n30 September\n6\n0\nThis video uses Vimeo’s DNT parameter.

On July 29th, Prime Minister Starmer's office issued a statement saying that the UK has gone bankrupt according to the results of the fiscal review.\n\nChina also held the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party from July 15th to 18th. According to the communiqué, there seems to be no clear blueprint for China's economic future. President Xi Jinping is vigorously promoting China's economic transformation. Will this affect his future re-election for a fourth term?\n\nGiven the above, from what perspectives and methods should we use astrology to analyze these events?",

I had some down-time last week due to illness and I am trying to ctach up with anything I missed during that period today.  The Mundane Matters meeting is the one event that isn't recorded. From the start, this was set up to be a friendly and informal discussion amongst all participants, that is very much 'in the moment' without any sense of being recorded or watched. I realise there are pros and cons to this and it may be that the policy changes -  I don't like to think some people are dissapointed at not being able to catch up with an event that is held at a time that is impossible to attend. The situation will stay like this for now, but I will be mindful that it needs recosideration soon.  \nThank you for your lovely sentiments too - I hope you are keeping well in yourself!",

But it seems like so much has happened in just the last few days - I am completely behind with all the news now :)!\n1\nJoanna Grant\n·\n1y\nWish I was a Night Owl so I could attend!!\n1\nWei\n·\n1y\nI would like to know if anyone is willing to discuss the future of the UK economy. On July 29th, Prime Minister Starmer's office issued a statement saying that the UK has gone bankrupt according to the results of the fiscal review.\n\nChina also held the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party from July 15th to 18th. According to the communiqué, there seems to be no clear blueprint for China's economic future. President Xi Jinping is vigorously promoting China's economic transformation. Will this affect his future re-election for a fourth term?\n\nGiven the above, from what perspectives and methods should we use astrology to analyze these events?\n1\nKealoha Cristiano\n·\n1y\nAloha SkyScript & STA team,\nI trust you are well. \n\nIn regards to the Mundane Matters, (I just visited the charts page). Are you going to make this video or other videos available?\n\nI would have a day off coming soon - I would like to watch your lecture. \n\nIf possible, okay. If not, all is well.\n\nSending you waves of Aloha - I am really really grateful for your work Deb - and so much respect and appreciation for the other tutors that are part of my journey Wade, Lee and Eve.\n\nHave a blessed day/ night,\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n1y\nI am really sorry for my late reply to this message Cristiano.  I had some down-time last week due to illness and I am trying to ctach up with anything I missed during that period today.  The Mundane Matters meeting is the one event that isn't recorded. From the start, this was set up to be a friendly and informal discussion amongst all participants, that is very much 'in the moment' without any sense of being recorded or watched. I realise there are pros and cons to this and it may be that the policy changes -  I don't like to think some people are dissapointed at not being able to catch up with an event that is held at a time that is impossible to attend. The situation will stay like this for now, but I will be mindful that it needs recosideration soon.  \nThank you for your lovely sentiments too - I hope you are keeping well in yourself!\n1\nCollapse replies\n\n\n\nRead more from your favourite creators.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nMundane Matters meeting this Thursday - with Wade Cave and Rod Chang\nA reminder that we’ll be holding our next Mundane Matters meeting this Thursday.

In preparation, I’ve created a number of charts related to the mundane and political issues of Israel, Palestine and Lebanon., all of which are available on Skyscript for those who might want to explore ahead of our meeting:  https://www.skyscript.co.uk/mm.html\nIn addition, with the upcoming Mars and Jupiter conjunction in mind, which falls on the fixed star Rigel, we will take the opportunity to consider the symbolism of the conjunction and remind ourselves of the general significance attached to this star.\n(In preparing the mundane charts, I noticed that the degree of this conjunction – and also  the current position of Mars on Prima Hyadum of Taurus, significant in a series of charts related to Hamas, Hezbollah,  and Lebanon. So I’m expecting an intensification of hostilities with a high possibility of military action and air strikes in the next few days).\n\nHope to see on Monday to explore the issues more deeply.\n6 comments\ncerise vablais\n·\n1y\nGREAT meeting last night and here we are - getting reports that Israel has bombed Beirut. \n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n1y\nI find the shared insights invaluable and get so much out of these kinds of events.

Drums - I also thought the right ear was significant. According to Lilly Saturn rules the right ear - CA, p.246 - and Saturn is culminating in Trump's SR this year, while ruling the 8th house and receiving the opposition of the Moon (it's not a good SR chart for Trump this year - one reason why I've been hesitant in judging out and out victory for him in the elections).  I've noticed the Trump team are directing blame on this towards Biden, by suggesting he has directed hate thoughts towards Trump.  I wonder whether this will add more pressure on Biden to step down. (Might be seen as another reason to bring in a fresh face now, who can be free of past-interaction with Trump after this very dramatic turn of events).  \nWhat with this news this morning, and England playing in the finals tonight, I'm not sure I can keep up with all the drama going on!",

    "full_content": "Mars-Uranus on Algol coming up\nSkyscript\n7 Jul 2024\n7\n58\nJust passing on an interesting ‘heads up’ that originated from Sheila Roher last week when we looked at the chart of Joe Biden wondering whether he would stand down or not; and if so, when?\nSheila pointed out how the volatile Mars-Uranus conjunction that perfects on 15th July at 26° Taurus falls upon Biden's natal 12-th house Sun. If Biden thinks he's over the worst it seems he's got more drama coming his way, especially since this harsh conjunction also lands on the degree of the destructive fixed star, Algol. The conjunction opposes Kamala Harris’s  MC-ruler Jupiter too (not sure this is a good thing for Harris, since her political standing might be more secure by being tied to Biden). At the very least, this pair look set to have their boats rocked even more than they have been of late.\nDrawing up some national foundation charts for Skyscript today, I also noticed how the conjunction is igniting the current return of Mars to its elevated and angular natal position (squared by Uranus) in the chart for the founding of the French Republic. The conjunction stirs the chart of Jordan Bardella too, who is leading the far-right opposition in the elections that are generating so much tension (and violence) across France right now.\nIn regard to UK politics, the conjunction lands upon the natal Moon of Tom Tugendhat, and it lights up the natal Uranus/Pluto/Saturn/Nep of Jeremy Hunt. Both of these politicians are likely to feel tense, excited, stretched and drawn out – presumably because the Conservative leadership spotlight will be zooming in their direction and holding their feet to the fire.\nAll the charts mentioned here can be found on this page:\nhttps://www.skyscript.co.uk/mm.html\n 58 comments\ncerise vablais\n·\n1y\nTime has been updated to 6:11 pm for the shooting \n2\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n1y\nIt seems the time was actually 6:11 pm - earlier reports suggested a little later, but they were based on noting social media and news feeds which were subject to delay.  Drums - I also thought the right ear was significant. According to Lilly Saturn rules the right ear - CA, p.246 - and Saturn is culminating in Trump's SR this year, while ruling the 8th house and receiving the opposition of the Moon (it's not a good SR chart for Trump this year - one reason why I've been hesitant in judging out and out victory for him in the elections).  I've noticed the Trump team are directing blame on this towards Biden, by suggesting he has directed hate thoughts towards Trump.  I wonder whether this will add more pressure on Biden to step down. (Might be seen as another reason to bring in a fresh face now, who can be free of past-interaction with Trump after this very dramatic turn of events).  \nWhat with this news this morning, and England playing in the finals tonight, I'm not sure I can keep up with all the drama going on!\n3\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n1y\nHere’s a timeline from the BBC \nHere's a breakdown of how that all unfolded. All times are local:\n17:00: Trump was scheduled to start addressing the crowd\n18:03: He takes the stage to Lee Hazelwood’s “God Bless the USA”\n18:11: Just a few minutes into his campaign speech, loud shots ring out\n18:12: Secret Service agents swarm the former president before he is rushed off stage with blood near his ear and on the side of his face\n18:14: Trump's motorcade leaves the rally\n2\ncerise vablais\n·\n1y\nCorrection: 6:15. pm\n2\ncerise vablais\n·\n1y\nHello all - the time of the shooting is being reported as 6:16 pm Eastern Daylight Time Butler, Pennsylvania.\n1\nThis comment has been removed.\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n1y\nWith Algol in the mix this BBC report was very interesting: ‘Trump received only minor injuries but it was close - a photograph by Doug Mills of the New York Times appears to show the streak of a bullet cutting through the air near the former president’s head.’  \n3\nLoad replies\nKarl Skellenger\n·\n1y\nThe transits on the 17th of July look pretty ominous for Biden\n\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/karlskellenger/p/july-17th-when-the-levee-breaks-biden?r=fjmlo&utm_medium=ios\n3\nLeena Chauhan\n·\n1y\nThe Daily Mail (right wing British tabloid press) is running a story that Michelle Obama might be tempted to run as the democratic candidate after all. Other US and UK media outlets have been running this story in recent days/ weeks too. Some say Obama and Taylor Swift are the dream ticket. \n\nThe Mars-Uranus conjunction trines Obama's Sun at 26 Cap and opposes Swift's Mars at 26 Sco.\n2\n4\nKarl Skellenger\n·\n1y\nI think it will be Harris, found some interesting alignments between her chart and the full moon on the first day of Democratic convention. https://open.substack.com/pub/karlskellenger/p/full-moon-rising-vs-the-lunar-eclipse?r=fjmlo&utm_medium=ios\n2\nLoad replies\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n1y\nMars-Uranus did their job on Marine !  They have been stymied … \n2\n4\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n1y\nIt comes as a relief to me to see that the far right were blocked, although still very troubling to think of the political manipulations that went on to move the vote from the far right to the far left.  Anything but Macron it seems :)  -And what a Neptunian mess to wade through now :)\n2\nLoad replies\nLeena Chauhan\n·\n1y\nThank you Deb, Sheila and everyone else for all this commentary. More nastiness and craziness on the horizon. Sigh.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the night before the Mars-Uranus conjunction, England may be in the Euros 2024 final. They've won every match so far in highly Mars-Uranus, nerve-shredding fashion already. Whoever ends up in the final, the tension will be on another level. Not sure how it can get any more acute for England football fans.\n\nThe conjunction provokes my own chart at the end of a long extended family weekend holiday. It promises to be intense even without that. Now I'm going to have to try extra hard not to be riled...\n2\n20\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n1y\nOh the football - I haven't even been thinking about that :)\n1\nLoad replies\nLoad more comments\nRead more from your favourite creators.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nWe meet again: 8:30 pm UTC, Sunday, 19 October 2025 – for the EPM Reading Group (2)\nJust a quick reminder that we meet again on Sunday (19 October 2025) for the 2nd England’s Prophetical Merlin Reading Group: 8:30 pm UTC CHE\n18 October\n0\n0\nReminder – Sun 17 Aug: Meira Epstein explores a Medieval Conundrum\nJust a quick reminder that this Sunday we’ll be welcoming back Meira Epstein for what promises to be a captivating journey into the medieval\n14 August\n2\n0\nA Medieval Horary: Ganivetus’ Sick Man - & October Update\nToday I completed my translation of ‘The Sick Man Horary’ by Ganivetus.

          "UK– it was easy to observe the astrological signature of Rishi Sunak failing (e.g., tr. Saturn sq n. Saturn / Uranus on Sun and opp n. Uranus) against the more Jupiterian Keir Starmer ascending to take the Prime Ministership of the UK, bringing a swing from the right-wing politics of the Conservatives (Tory party) to the more left-leaning politics of Labour. But we also noted the chart of Nigel Farage, who seems very plugged into the Plutonic signature of this election and who – increasingly – attracts media headlines with his return to politics and the potential rise of a more extreme-right ‘Reform’ party under his leadership.  (We noted the synastry connections between Farage and Donald Trump, who he is closely aligned with politically).  The demise of the Tory party seems less about a swing from right to left for Britain and more about a broadscale lack of trust in the current government or little confidence in it having an effective grip on events or an inspiring plan moving forward.  So Britain seems ready to try any change, but its political path still seems uncertain in Starmer’s untested hands."

          "FRANCE– we compared the chart of Emmanuel Macron against Jordan Bardella, who seems poised to take over the presidency and move France in a far-right direction as leader of the National Rally (RN) party.  It was interesting to note how both Macron and Bardella have the Moon at 14 Taurus (the degree of Jupiter at the Aries Ingress). Bardella has Sun in Virgo (20°) in opposition to Saturn in Pisces (21°) so he is currently undergoing a Saturn return. This seems to fit the profile of a young politician taking on a great deal more responsibility, and it also meshes with the theme of the French Aries ingress, which has a strong Saturnian feel – Capricorn rising and the MC in Scorpio governed by Mars at 27° Aquarius, which falls in trine with Bardella’s North node on the MC at 26° Libra.There are several strong synastry connections between Macron and Bardella, which suggests these two are likely to be vying with each other (perhaps in alternating roles of leader and opposition leader) for a while. The younger Bardella is definitely up-and-coming and worth noting now as a new player in world politics."

          "INDIA– we looked at the chart of Narendra Modi, who has been Prime Minister of India since 2014, with such an overwhelming majority that he hasn’t had to deal with an effective opposition party.  A member of the right-wing BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), although he retained his Prime Ministership this year, the recent Indian elections were seen as a major blow for him.  We compared with the chart of Rahul Gandhi, of the more democratic INC (Indian National Congress), who also claimed victory by gaining enough support to take away Modi’s majority. This has been described as a “stunning blow” for the 73-year-old Modi, who had expected a landslide victory.  It is good that we have a perfectly documented AA-rated chart for Rahul – he provided the evidence himself from published reports at the time of his birth:“Sonia Gandhi … gave birth to Rahul on 19.6.1970 at 2.28 pm. She was admitted to the hospital at 9.10 am the same day.”(full report onastro.com)With Jupiter rising upon his ascendant, translating between the trine of his elevated and rejoicing 9th-house Sun and the received sextile from his rejoicing 3rd-house Moon, and with Venus culminating in the MC, no wonder he is happy to release his data.  I chuckled when I drew up his chart and saw he was born in the day and hour of Venus, too. This man is definitely one to watch as he climbs in popularity as an upcoming leader of the world’s most populous nation."

    "full_content": "Updates & follow up to last week's Mundane Matters meeting\nSkyscript\n2 Jul 2024\n7\n14\nI have wanted to circulate this post since the close of our Mundane Matters meeting last Thursday – it has taken until now as I got a bit carried away with the preparation of it :)\n Firstly, apologies again to anyone inconvenienced by the login difficulties in the Skyscript Zoom room last Thursday, and thank you for changing venues with me so quickly. The password had indeed changed, though I had no knowledge of this! Zoom did it during a program update earlier that week. I've contacted their customer support to ask them to explain and ensure this does not happen again. The usual password has been reinstated, and I’m confident we should not have this problem repeated.\nI enjoyed the last MM meeting. It was good to explore nativities relating to nations undergoing political crises and get insight from members such as Leena, who helped us understand the political landscape in India. I’ll outline what we covered first, then explain where you can easily access all the charts discussed in the meeting.\nBrief meeting recap\nWe looked at the nativities of leaders involved in the elections looming in the UK and France (alongside their ingress charts) and the consequences of the recent election held in India.\nUK – it was easy to observe the astrological signature of Rishi Sunak failing (e.g., tr. Saturn sq n. Saturn / Uranus on Sun and opp n. Uranus) against the more Jupiterian Keir Starmer ascending to take the Prime Ministership of the UK, bringing a swing from the right-wing politics of the Conservatives (Tory party) to the more left-leaning politics of Labour. But we also noted the chart of Nigel Farage, who seems very plugged into the Plutonic signature of this election and who – increasingly – attracts media headlines with his return to politics and the potential rise of a more extreme-right ‘Reform’ party under his leadership.  (We noted the synastry connections between Farage and Donald Trump, who he is closely aligned with politically).  The demise of the Tory party seems less about a swing from right to left for Britain and more about a broadscale lack of trust in the current government or little confidence in it having an effective grip on events or an inspiring plan moving forward.  So Britain seems ready to try any change, but its political path still seems uncertain in Starmer’s untested hands.\nFRANCE – we compared the chart of Emmanuel Macron against Jordan Bardella, who seems poised to take over the presidency and move France in a far-right direction as leader of the National Rally (RN) party.  It was interesting to note how both Macron and Bardella have the Moon at 14 Taurus (the degree of Jupiter at the Aries Ingress). Bardella has Sun in Virgo (20°) in opposition to Saturn in Pisces (21°) so he is currently undergoing a Saturn return. This seems to fit the profile of a young politician taking on a great deal more responsibility, and it also meshes with the theme of the French Aries ingress, which has a strong Saturnian feel – Capricorn rising and the MC in Scorpio governed by Mars at 27° Aquarius, which falls in trine with Bardella’s North node on the MC at 26° Libra. \nThere are several strong synastry connections between Macron and Bardella, which suggests these two are likely to be vying with each other (perhaps in alternating roles of leader and opposition leader) for a while. The younger Bardella is definitely up-and-coming and worth noting now as a new player in world politics.  \n INDIA – we looked at the chart of Narendra Modi, who has been Prime Minister of India since 2014, with such an overwhelming majority that he hasn’t had to deal with an effective opposition party.  A member of the right-wing BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), although he retained his Prime Ministership this year, the recent Indian elections were seen as a major blow for him.  We compared with the chart of Rahul Gandhi, of the more democratic INC (Indian National Congress), who also claimed victory by gaining enough support to take away Modi’s majority. This has been described as a “stunning blow” for the 73-year-old Modi, who had expected a landslide victory.  It is good that we have a perfectly documented AA-rated chart for Rahul – he provided the evidence himself from published reports at the time of his birth:\n“Sonia Gandhi … gave birth to Rahul on 19.6.1970 at 2.28 pm. She was admitted to the hospital at 9.10 am the same day.”\n(full report on astro.com)\nWith Jupiter rising upon his ascendant, translating between the trine of his elevated and rejoicing 9th-house Sun and the received sextile from his rejoicing 3rd-house Moon, and with Venus culminating in the MC, no wonder he is happy to release his data.  I chuckled when I drew up his chart and saw he was born in the day and hour of Venus, too. This man is definitely one to watch as he climbs in popularity as an upcoming leader of the world’s most populous nation.\n  Get quick access to all the charts\n Immediately after the meeting, I planned to circulate a copy of all the charts to members. However, as I started to put a PDF together, I realised how much better it would be to create an online page where all of these charts can be found instantly and brought into view at any time with a single mouse-click on a name.\nNow that we have the ‘pinnable chart’ feature on all new Skyscript pages, it is easy to fix any two charts on the screen and compare them with each other to check how political allies or enemies relate to each other or mundane astrological themes. \nSo all of the charts – including the ingress and opening of the polls charts – have been made available on the Skyscript page shown in the graphic at the top of this post:\nskyscript.co.uk/mm.html\nTake a quick visit and click around. The pinnable chart options are limited on mobile and tablets, but desktop computers make the comparison of two or three charts very simple and easy.\nI am really excited about the potential of what can be achieved on this page with further development and navigation enhancement. As time allows, I will add in many more mundane charts of interest to build this page into a resource library. I am currently exploring the possibility of being able to easily cross-reference any selection of 2,3 or even 4 charts together in a way that fades the background content and allows instant selection/deselection from (what will build into) an extensive collection of charts of mundane events and national leaders.\n Sadly, I have to park further development of this right now, but will return to it as time allows. From now on, no good chart will go to waste or fail to be archived for easy reference, and - moving forward - all charts used in Mundane Matters meetings will be shared on his page.  I have added a link to it in the members’ area.\nDate and topics for our next meeting\nThe ‘4-week-on’ date for our next meeting falls on my wedding anniversary.  As I don’t want my husband demanding a divorce that day, I rescheduled to the same time on the following Monday, 29 July (details have been added to the member’s area, and I’ll circulate a reminder post with full details nearer the time).\nTomorrow, a new flier will be circulated with details of the summer and early autumn program of Skyscript talks and presentations. You will see we have an event purely themed on the US election scheduled for September 12th – for that reason, I would like to keep the next Mundane Matters meeting relatively US-free and continue the exploration of charts of other national leaders.  (Let’s see if I can go a whole meeting without using the T word :))\n Israel was mentioned last week, so I propose that we consider the situation there and also the chart of the Paramount Leader of China, Xi Jinping, to better understand the political situation there since China has such an important influence on world affairs.\nIn addition to these national issues—and especially since our next meeting coincides with a Moon-Mars-Jupiter conjunction in Gemini, with Jupiter moving into alignment with the fixed star Rigel (17° Gem)—I would like the third part of our next meeting to explore the associations and symbolism of Rigel and the constellation Orion. Rigel is one of the brightest stars in the sky, so it seems very fitting for that to get some attention as such a dramatic light show moves towards it.\nQuick update on other news\n I have prepared handouts and notes for the first part of Manilius’s Astronomica book II - to be used in our next ‘Reading Manilius’ group meeting on 11th July. I have an interesting extract to circulate in advance of that, which will be released with further info on that meeting on Thursday this week.\nThese last few months have been incredibly demanding on the back-end coding of Skyscript. It is a complex situation as we start to move towards a ‘single sign-on’ experience, but good progress is being made, and this is very exciting and important in terms of the site’s long-term development. I’m not in a good position to reveal developments yet, but want you to realise that while I have been slow in circulating the next newsletter, this is not because things are not happening. \nWith several events organised, posts scheduled, and tasks at a point where I can ‘park for now,’ I intend to now focus fully on pulling the next newsletter together. No one talk to me for a while. Expect me to disappear from social media, etc., while I go down the mine with our next issue. I'll reappear when I have something tangible to show.\nThanks for bearing with my very chaotic schedule – I cannot believe no one has complained that the newsletter is so overdue. My Virgo nervousness is tautly stretched between relief for that and anxiety that you’ve all given up on me.\nFear not – I will be back!\nThank you for your continued support, and all the best from me for now :)\nDeb\n14 comments\nThis comment has been removed.\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n1y\nWell the reason he was laughing on the floor this time was only because it was (apparently) so obvious to everyone that Labour was going to win the election.

In this year of the Dragon, we delve into the applications of these astrological systems. Chinese astrologers use these as a foundation for yearly predictions, guiding individuals on whether it will be a year of fortune or challenge for each sign. They also recommend specific lucky charms to enhance luck and prosperity. Jupiter will give hands-on insight into these fascinating astrological practices.\n------------------------\n\nJupiter Lai teaches astrology in Hong Kong, China and Malaysia. She is the co-founder, along with Rod Chang, of the Academy of Astrology, founded in 2008 to promote Western Astrology to Chinese speakers. Jupiter teaches for the STA School of Astrology and lectures on a wide range of astrological subjects, incorporating Chinese astrology, I-Ching and Feng Shui into her own astrological practice. Through the work of the Academy, Jupiter has helped to introduce many international speakers to Asia, where they have shared their astrological insights with local students. Jupiter’s personal website is at www.magiclife.com.hk. She can be contacted via email at jupiter@sta.co.\n3 comments\nWade Caves\n·\n1y\nThank you for this interesting detail, Cristiano!

Rob gave me the copyright for this and passed on hopes that it would be shared as widely as possible - he anticipated that this would be the last public event he would make as an astrologer, and both of us were pleased to be able to demonstrate our enduring friendship and mutual respect in this informative and good-spirited way. However, it doesn't seem appropriate to me to share it publicly in its current form because of how it shows the faces of the attending delegates. I think it is fine to share it here, in a closed environment to sincere members of the astro-community. I'll give thought to whether I can edit the video to mask out faces, to use parts of it in a more public capacity at a later date.This recording is just over 3 hours long. I have trimmed just a couple of minutes from the video that involved a prolonged discussion (at the midway point) on whether the meeting was still being recorded and a little later when Rob took a while to find a book he was looking for—nothing of relevance was being featured at those points.",

I'll give thought to whether I can edit the video to mask out faces, to use parts of it in a more public capacity at a later date.<br/><br/>This recording is just over 3 hours long. I have trimmed just a couple of minutes from the video that involved a prolonged discussion (at the midway point) on whether the meeting was still being recorded and a little later when Rob took a while to find a book he was looking for—nothing of relevance was being featured at those points.</p>"

I am happy to announce that I can now share the recording of that event with all Skyscript Patrons. Copies of the video are embedded in the members' page, and for those who prefer to simply listen in, there is also an audio file available.\nWhen Rob asked if I would join him for this event, he was keen to correct a false impression that he had anything but respect for arguments concerning reviewing the history of house division. Of course, my position was likewise. Rob gave me the copyright for this and passed on hopes that it would be shared as widely as possible - he anticipated that this would be the last public event he would make as an astrologer, and both of us were pleased to be able to demonstrate our enduring friendship and mutual respect in this informative and good-spirited way. However, it doesn't seem appropriate to me to share it publicly in its current form because of how it shows the faces of the attending delegates. I think it is fine to share it here, in a closed environment to sincere members of the astro-community.

Consider, for example, that the site might have some content that's copyrighted. It could include personal data such as birth information or sensitive content on the forum. You would certainly not want expose sensitive data or be liable for inadvertently sharing it. There is a lot to think about and take care of here, which you might have done to a large part already. I'm just highlighting the fact that AI technology brings new challenges that need specific and targeted responses.\n6\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThanks for highlighting this - I've updated the robots.txt file today to include the following (it is another minefield to get into, so I'll also get this checked out by someone who understands it all better than I do).  \n\nUser-agent: ChatGPT-User\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: GPTBot\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: Google-Extended\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: anthropic-ai\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: Claude-Web\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: Twitterbot\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: FacebookBot\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: CCBot\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: cohere-ai\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: CCBot\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: omgilibot\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: omgili\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: Amazonbot\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: Applebot\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: PerplexityBot\nDisallow: /\n\nUser-agent: YouBot\nDisallow: /\n1\nCollapse replies\n\nRead more from your favourite creators.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nHappening today: Alberto Forero on Lilly’s Marriage Indications\nQuick reminder that our live Skyscript Speaker Event with Alberto Forero is happening today.

I am delaying the publication of the next Skyscript newsletter until late May – not without good reason.\nI have been working hard on Skyscript development, and over recent weeks, I’ve reached a position where I can start implementing significant improvements and adding a lot of new content and resources. ( I’ve been close to this point a few times, but then a newsletter deadline took over and pushed me back, so whatever needed to be coordinated suffered or fell apart.)\n Since the newsletter is published as a fundraiser to support the development of the website, it makes sense for me to relax its schedule during pivotal times when energies are needed on important site tasks. Your support is central to these developments, and I am always grateful for it (we are in this together!).\nI anticipate the next newsletter will be circulated in late May. I have some great contributions collected for that, and I’m eager to put that material together as soon as I can. I really do love working on the newsletter—nothing gives me greater pleasure than showcasing well-written, informative, and inspiring astrology content, so rest assured this is only a necessary delay and not a major change of plan.\nIn the interim, I expect to more than make up for what you will miss with the newsletter because this deadline relaxation will allow me to share some extra resources that I have planned for Skyscript patrons. Over the next few weeks, you can expect to hear from me regularly as I document the improvements being made to the site, give news of resources that will benefit you and share some privileged extras with you.\n So today, I would simply encourage you to visit the site's home page and check out the collection of articles that have been recently added or renovated.

The dominant view was that they were disruptive in a harmful way, but a counter view held that they could be positive.This talk will look at the general context within which the comets were observed and interpreted, focussing on two texts, that of John Bainbridge (who became the first Savillean Professor of Astronomy at Oxford) in December 1618, during a period of relative stability under the English king James I (James VI of Scotland), and that of William Lilly 26 years later in 1644, published in the opening stages of the traumatic English civil war.

    "full_content": "British Royals - Skyscript chart collection\nSkyscript\n17 Mar 2024\n9\n13\nI've been organising some of the resources on Skyscript.  You might find this page handy - a gallery collection of all the charts on site concerning the British royals and monarchy-related events.\n\nhttps://www.skyscript.co.uk/royalcharts.html\n\nThese are charts of people that are always in the news, and because most of these charts are very well timed they make great natal studies. Seeing all the charts together, it is easy to note the connections between them and how this plays out in family dynamics and inter-generational dramas. (Such a lot going on in Cancer - but unfortunately, Meghan's Mars is there  -:)  There are hot spots in Libra and Scorpio, too - it's really fascinating to see note the connections being repeated from one generation to the next.\nThere's currently 25 charts on the page - the number will grow as I add in more historical charts.\n13 comments\nElissa Solari\n·\n2y\nThank you!  So helpful!\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nGlad you think so Lisa :)\nCollapse replies\nLeena Chauhan\n·\n2y\nThanks so much for this Deb! Brilliantly timed given how the younger royals are all part of the upcoming eclipse action.\n1\n4\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nYes, poor Catherine in particular - even just doing absolutely nothing at all leads to criticisms that she is missing in action, or has a much worse health complaint that she is owning up to. She's probably not even real if you read the reports on Twitter.  It's been all over the socials that Charles died today but Buckingham Palace are keeping it secret.  I wonder who dreams these things up :)\n1\nLoad replies\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n2y\nGreat thanks a lot Deb. I was actually thinking of looking them up this morning reading about Meghan’s new project and all the buzz around the missing Kate ! Great timing 🙏🙏🙏\n2\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nI didn't know about Meghan's new brand - bur one of the reasons I put this page together was to act as further resources on the web page that offers my narrative on her chart - you've probably seen that already but I'll share the link shortly.\n2\nCollapse replies\nLara van Zuydam\n·\n2y\nBrilliant - thanks, Deb!\n1\nMarisa Dinis\n·\n2y\nHi Deb, great resource!

All very clear on MacBook pro, and I like the fixing of the chart on the page; however, I felt that it would have been better perhaps to have it fixed on the bottom left side of the screen as that side has more 'blank' space and does not sit so much on the text.  It still works on the right but the text is hidden a bit and needs to be scrolled up.  No issue on Mac between the Alan Leo / Astro report bit unless perhaps you have already changed it :) thanks for everything (PS: tradgedies with an extra 'd' in para 1:):))",

I am using a windows PC version 10. Google browser; the pieces on the left in the \"margin\" the poem etc, in particular for this article seem faint. For comparison, this page that I am looking at here on Patreon, is very clear, the contrast is different.

The font in the left-hand margin *is* a bit of a compromise, to get a nice design balance to the page, but all of the content there is supplementary and not strictly necessary - in a mobile view that left side margin is dumped and doesn't appear at all.  Also - check how this appears to you in the print view.  I tried to set that up so that if someone doesn't enjoy reading on-screen, there is a good clear printout that is easily read.",

The text has astrological symbols and working hyperlinks for footnotes and references.\nIf any of these elements are not working well, or if you find anything on the page unattractive or problematic, will you please let me know?

(I know a lot about Byron because he lived at Newstead Abbey, about 6 miles away from my house – so he was a local lad for me :) )\nAgain - thanks if you will check this article out and report any problems.\nhttps://www.skyscript.co.uk/shelley.html\n38 comments\nDiane Waldstätten\n·\n2y\nHI, Deb, the following links did not work: \n...fixed star Dubhe (of Ursa Major).... \n1\n2\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThanks, Diane - the reason is that the page doesn't exist yet, but it will soon, so I added the link now in case I forget to come back and add it later. At least this shows you are being diligent :)\nLoad replies\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n2y\nThanks a lot for this Deb - beautiful article and great layout and added art work.  All very clear on MacBook pro, and I like the fixing of the chart on the page; however, I felt that it would have been better perhaps to have it fixed on the bottom left side of the screen as that side has more 'blank' space and does not sit so much on the text.  It still works on the right but the text is hidden a bit and needs to be scrolled up.  No issue on Mac between the Alan Leo / Astro report bit unless perhaps you have already changed it :) thanks for everything (PS: tradgedies with an extra 'd' in para 1:):))\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nYes, you are right! I am trying to remember why I put it on the right instead of the left - I feel there was a reason, but I can't remember what it was and I just moved it across and it seems to work fine there.  Good point - and thanks for the typo alert too :)\n1\nCollapse replies\nPatricia New\n·\n2y\nHi Deb, incredibly fascinating article!  I read on a pc desktop using Edge as a browser and I had no trouble with the chart pop outs or the article at the bottom.  Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge.  \n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThank you Patricia! Comments like that warm my heart :)\nCollapse replies\nAlberto Forero\n·\n2y\nHi Deb, looks great! One tiny thing I saw on my setup (Macbook pro, Firefox 123.0.1) was that the inset pages from the Alan Leo book, at the bottom of the page appear to be a little zoomed in, and run into the caption below (\"Astrological report...\"). Would be great to add some breathing room between the bottom of the Alan Leo inset and the caption below it. I love the pinned charts!  Cheers - Alberto\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nHi Alberto.  Thank you - that is valuable feedback. I also got a message today from Dru saying she was having some issues with that element too, so I'll take another look at it tomorrow.  That is why this feedback is so useful, because that bit looks lovely to me. Reminds me of the message most websites carried in the late 1990s (don't see it so much anymore): \"This website looks best on [insert browser and resolution here]\".  Oh, how I miss the old simple days :)\n1\nCollapse replies\nSuzanne Sanders\n·\n2y\nLove that fixed chart feature! I always have a hard time following chart analysis so this is a huge plus. It lays out very nicely on my small mobile screen iOS and looks great on desktop in arc browser. Well done. Wish I had the dev chops for my own blog!\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThanks Suzanne! :)\nCollapse replies\nFélix\n·\n2y\nWhat a tragic life! On iPhone 13 it looks perfect, and very useful to leave the chart fixed. Thank you\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThank you - and yes, wasn't it just?!  Makes me wonder whether there was something back in the family line that left a curse on the lot of them - if this was a novel - and then you added the detail of the eldest son dying by lightning strike - no one would pubish; just too unreal! :)\n1\nCollapse replies\nThyra\n·\n2y\nEverything works as expected and looks super nice with latest Safari on MacBook Air 13\", iPhone Pro Max 14 and iPad mini. On the iPhone and on the iPad mini in portrait mode the page is displayed a tiny bit zoomed in, which looks like the content being off-center. Might be the same as with the Android mentioned above. Fix/unfix of a chart is just great - love it!\n1\n4\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThat's great feedback - thanks Thyra.  I thought I had sorted out the off-centre display for mobiles but it's always the case that when you get it looking good on one device, you then find a problem with another, so I'll give it another iPhone overhaul to see if I can weed that out.  The good thing with style sheets is that it's a continual improvement thing - so even if I don't crack it today, I'll crack it soon and things will get retrospectively improved.\n1\nLoad replies\nLeena Chauhan\n·\n2y\nLooks great on my iPhone SE 2022. LOVE the ‘fix/unfix’ chart feature!\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThanks - I think the fix chart feature is one detail that can actually give onscreen viewing an edge over print view.\n1\nCollapse replies\nZin Mar\n·\n2y\nHi Deb, I’m using desktop version to run the page and it is working well. Also the charts are remained on the screen at the lower right corner if I clicked and able to be unfixed as well. \n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThank you\nCollapse replies\nJoanna Grant\n·\n2y\nA beautiful article Deb, it looks very elegant... well done! I particularly like the art additions. My only comment would be, and this would apply to all the \"new\" content, is that the contrast (between text and background) seems slightly lower, and therefore (for me) less easy to read generally? I am using a windows PC version 10. Google browser; the pieces on the left in the \"margin\" the poem etc, in particular for this article seem faint. For comparison, this page that I am looking at here on Patreon, is very clear, the contrast is different. Anyway, that would be my only comment from this elderly & now visually challenged representative!! :) \n2\n5\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThanks Joanna - that is valuable feedback.  Is the main article text clear to read?  It ought to be; I have a good font there, and it is set against a white background, so it should be as clear as anything you read here.  The font in the left-hand margin *is* a bit of a compromise, to get a nice design balance to the page, but all of the content there is supplementary and not strictly necessary - in a mobile view that left side margin is dumped and doesn't appear at all.  Also - check how this appears to you in the print view.  I tried to set that up so that if someone doesn't enjoy reading on-screen, there is a good clear printout that is easily read.\nLoad replies\nLoad more comments\n\nRead more from your favourite creators.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nThe Ganivet Chart Form\nA little more on the Ganivet horary (the interpretation will follow in full to members this weekend).

Yes, that was what numerous ancient sources report.  Not sure when the definition changed - it is currently about 66°30′ N (the angular distance from the pole is the same as the angular distance of the ecliptic from the equator - so about 23 1/2° down from the pole, rather than the 36° Manilius reports).

Yes, that was what numerous ancient sources report.  Not sure when the definition changed - it is currently about 66°30′ N (the angular distance from the pole is the same as the angular distance of the ecliptic from the equator - so about 23 1/2° down from the pole, rather than the 36° Manilius reports).

In keeping with the gravity of that, it refuses to be rushed and insists on taking its time. It should be ready to distribute very soon (all being well, within the next week), but there is one feature within it that is very timely – and I don’t want it to miss its mark, so I am releasing it as an early exposure.\nSheila Roher has continued her series on the astrology of dreams by compiling a fascinating article that pursues an exploration of dreams recorded by Abraham Lincoln. Reading this article is really an astrological lesson and a workshop in itself, as well as a philosophical feast, so if you have some time to set aside, please don’t ignore it – it is validating for astrology in so many ways and left me musing deeply on the impression that Lincoln left upon the world as an individual, and the impression that elements of divination made upon him as an individual.\nIt is timely because Lincoln was born on the 12th February - a day set aside as a national holiday (President’s day) in some states of the USA. So, wherever you live in the world, let’s recognise the solar return of a great man in history, and give thought to the magical mystery of a world that surrounds us with omens, warnings and symbols.\nThe article extract is attached as a PDF file to this post, and here is the link to take you straight to it as a flipbook in the Skyscript members area:\nhttps://www.skyscript.co.uk/patron/news.php#current\nAnd thank you Sheila. I never feel comfortable when the newsletter is starting to feel ‘overdue’, but my original concept of a light monthly circular to be spread by email has developed into something altogether different, and the quality of the articles within it of late, such as this one, restore my calm, and make me realise that my self-imposed deadlines should not cause me stress. So, instead, I relax and take a moment to enjoy the satisfaction of playing a part in bringing great astrological content like this to the attention of colleagues who will surely appreciate it as much as I do myself.\nPS – I will have no internet tomorrow, as British Telecom attempts (once again - I'll spare you the saga) to replace my old copper wiring with super-speed fibre. I am patient with their inept, feeble attempts to complete this task, realising that Saturn on my MC needs to out somewhere. Hopefully, I will be back online again on Tuesday.\nPPS – And Happy New Chinese Year of the Dragon to everyone!!\nAttachments\nDownload all\n15.pdf\n27 comments\nHMA\n·\n2y\nWould this be an interesting research project?\nFrom Wikipedia: Robert Todd Lincoln (Abraham Lincoln's son) was once saved from possible serious injury or death by Edwin Booth, whose brother, John Wilkes Booth, assassinated Robert's father.

    "full_content": "Skyscript brainstorming - Sat, 9th December\nSkyscript\n8 Dec 2023\n6\n16\n\nA reminder that there will be a Skyscript online Zoom meeting tomorrow, Saturday 9th December, which will not be an astrological talk or a presentation, but an open meeting to explore and discuss ideas and suggestions for the future development of Skyscript. This will also be an opportunity for me to provide an update on some of my plans, but I am most keen to get some community feedback at this time. I particularly want to hear ideas from members who might want to get more connected and involved.  There is also a plan to start up a monthly discussion group of mundane and astronomical themes - I would want that to be a community-led group, so I will be welcoming feedback and ideas on that.\nI expect the meeting to last about an hour, but have scheduled 75 mins. All Patreon members are invited to this meeting - I hope you can find time to participate. \nDetails:\nSaturday December 9th, 2023\n6pm UTC - check your local time on this Time and Date link\nSkyscript Zoom link: http://us06web.zoom.us/j/6123333126\n- the password (Skyscript) is embedded in the link\n16 comments\nLeena Chauhan\n·\n2y\nSorry I missed this.

Sorry to hear about the death of your friend, but I think you took the right lesson from it in terms of looking into how to make your website outlive you. It is super important to have astrology websites that are independent of the big tech platforms — yes, there is a lot of great astrology information on YouTube, but YouTube also has the power to capriciously delete accounts with content it deems controversial. So far astrologers haven't been a major target of YouTube's purges, but how these purges historically tend to go is one group today and the next tomorrow. \n4\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThanks Eva - I totally agree\n1\nCollapse replies\nSuzanne Sanders\n·\n2y\nDarn.. the zoom link doesn't seem to be working for me.

When a message is deciphered there is a feeling of deep connection (I get goosebumps when that happens) and it cannot be taught just as set pieces. It is like a ‘religious’ calling - hence ‘divination’ being from the divine. I find SM very depressing when I see the Astro babble and other rubbish being said/peddled as astrology.  Wisdom takes too long in our day and age apparently- although not much is achieved without it ultimately. Thanks 🙏 again for this thought-provoking piece.",

    "full_content": "Issue 13 – the November edition of the newsletter is out!\nSkyscript\n1 Nov 2023\n13\n16\n\nAfter a great deal of labour pains, ‘lucky’ issue 13 of the newsletter has now been birthed!\nThe content in this issue goes deeper than Pluto’s belly button, and it's now very topical, and  ‘hot’ – so dive into it as soon as possible.\nAs usual, I have attached a low-resolution copy of the newsletter to this post, but the best viewing experience is gained through the high-resolution issue you can view as a flipbook or PDF, or download, from the members area at  https://www.skyscript.co.uk/patron/news.php\nRemember:  Your username is the email address that you use for this Patreon account\nThe password is (all lower case): regio\n\nHere is a quick low down –\nIf you haven’t read Kayleigh’s piece already, you really want to read that one right now, while the Samhain season is all around us.\nJason’s month ahead proved to be very ‘on point’ - even though it was written in September.  It features early-month configurations so don’t delay on that one.\nWade offers an extremely useful astro-overview of the Israel-Palestine situation.  Even if you are not a fan of mundane astrology, you will find this very easy to digest – and mind-blowing in the power of the astro-connections. Note the seminar Wade is giving on 3rd November to follow this piece up – you will find details on page 25.\nAbigail has penned a top-notch opinion piece. I happen to agree with every word she says. Whether you do or not, you will have to agree that her points are persuasive and very elegantly made – Abigail: once again I applaud you :)\nMy translation of Firmicus ‘On the Signs’ has been completed and accompanied with a collection of helpful tables.\n\nThere's other bits and bobs in too. Remember, we LOVE to get comments, feedback, suggestions – even criticisms (a little bit) as evidence that our thoughts are drifting through to yours!\nHope you enjoy the read!\n(And thanks for your patience with this one)\nDeb\nAttachments\nDownload all\nskyscript_newsletter_13_R.pdf\n16 comments\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n2y\nAbigail has put into words how I’ve always felt about astrology and I 100% agree with her view: it is an Art, of the heart and soul. When a message is deciphered there is a feeling of deep connection (I get goosebumps when that happens) and it cannot be taught just as set pieces. It is like a ‘religious’ calling - hence ‘divination’ being from the divine. I find SM very depressing when I see the Astro babble and other rubbish being said/peddled as astrology.  Wisdom takes too long in our day and age apparently- although not much is achieved without it ultimately. Thanks 🙏 again for this thought-provoking piece. \n5\n2\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nI also agree  - with both of you :)\n2\nLoad replies\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThere was a mistake with the Sam Bankman-Fried trial commencement chart on page 18 - it was showing the same chart as the Trump commencement trial - this has been fixed now, in case anyone got confused about that.\n1\n6\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n2y\nAnd here’s the result !

(And as for Adam Johnson's freak accident - what an uncanny - if horrific - expression of transiting Uranus on someone's Mars... ) (I hadn't realized that occurred in a public game, btw; that had to have been traumatic for all present.)  \n5\n2\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nYes, absolutely Ray. From what I gather, people in the crowd were screaming, and some were passing out. My daughter is still very upset by the shock of the awful situation.

So something beautiful is swilling around here and developing finer points of Astro-symbolism - despite my moans and grumbles about thing’s that are standing in my way right now, my nasal steam recedes upon contemplation of the ‘Great Work’ Kayleigh alludes to. :)",

    "full_content": "May need to postpone & delay a little right now\nSkyscript\n19 Oct 2023\n12\n15\nHi everyone\nWithout making a definite statement, for the sake of anyone planning ahead I want to give warning that I might have to cancel/postpone next week’s member's meeting planned for 25th October.  I am not feeling too well at the moment – I felt my energies drop dramatically at last weekend’s AA conference, where the slightest exertion left me struggling for breath (my talks were delivered, but with what felt like a great deal of strain on my part).\nUpon returning home I felt even more exhausted, and I have lost my energy and my voice – I am Taurean, so always the voice is the first to go when I am under stain, and infection always comes out ‘in the throat’.  What I have feels like covid, although the tests I have taken are negative, so maybe it is just the flu.\nIt feels good to be home, so hopefully a few days of not pushing myself too hard will be all I need to perk up again.  I am having a few hours of brain function each day and enjoying working on the newsletter.  As I don’t have it in me to ‘ramp up’ my energies right now, I am putting aside the ingress as a ‘deadline’ but look forward to circulating that as soon as I can.  (There is a really great article within it by Kayleigh Jean exploring the symbolism of Scorpio in fascinating ways, and I am very excited about sharing that with you).\nI hope my current inadequacy is not too inconvenient for anyone.\nSending my best wishes to you all in what seems like a very sad time for the world.\n15 comments\nJean Elliott\n·\n2y\nI am sorry to hear you are not feeling well and hope you get better soon.

        "text": "So I really enjoyed Neptunalia, which was hilariously \"Neptunian\" :) Having a very \"Neptunian\" family, I will just add a brief sketch: Neptune is an inspiration and a deceiver, a musician and a dreamer, an addict and a liar, a drinker and a dealer, a tramp and a healer. \nI am one of three children of a woman born under a very tight Moon Neptune conjunction. A keen horsewoman when young, she yearned to become a doctor but had parents who did not believe in education for women. Her father inherited a shipping company, and her mother was an artist. She married a man who had only ever worked on the sea, and when he wasn't there, he was painting. During her lifetime, she had two boats named after her.\nMy siblings and I all have hard Neptune Moon contacts. My sister trained as a nurse, although her last job was as a chef on a trans-Atlantic yacht charter; she also volunteered on the inshore lifeboat (my mother raised the money to have this built). My brother has made and ridden surfboards all his life, although now he works mainly in a boat yard, and in his spare time, he is very involved with the local rowing club, another project my mother helped to found; his wife runs an organisation that looks after fisherman's welfare. Always \"cursed\" with an overactive imagination, I ran away from home at an early age and got involved with a different kind of life... exploring mysticism, divination and the unseen realms. My children reflect my 5th house Neptune, one with a Moon Neptune conjunction, the other, a  12th house Moon. Both are keen swimmers (I taught them both before they were 5), they also play music, and one has trained in social care; their father is a fishing guide.",

A lot of fun but part of me wants to chalk that down to a practice event with an eye to a more global 24-hour event next year with a program of speakers - partnering with others, so it can roll right around the world and folks can dip in for an hour or two when the time zone swings round to them. I like the idea of everyone having a certain day to think about astrology and revive an ancient festival. We'll see - since then I've noticed some amazing Neptune events (and horasres), and I keep thinking \"that would be such a good piece to feature ...\nBut wow Joanna - what a backstory and interesting family history (and lineage) history you have. Your mother sounds like a perfect case study for the signature of Neptune in the natal, and she definitely passed that down the family line - strong Moon-Neptune aspects: no getting away from the sea for you lot !

It reminded me of one of our dogs, that my mother had, who always \"knew\" when my brother was returning home.... this was in the eighties and he was always on some surf safari or other to some far-flung destination.... and never communicated when he was to come back home. I decided that rather than the dog being \"psychic\" as my mother insisted, it was rather that the dog was aware of my mother's psychic abilities, which, with a Moon Neptune conjunction, she undoubtedly had. I thought it would be interesting to see the chart of the lady who reared the foal and who was her keeper.",

I might give up soon and try again tomorrow.\n\nCheers everyone !\n10 comments\nJoanna Grant\n·\n2y\nSo I really enjoyed Neptunalia, which was hilariously \"Neptunian\" :) Having a very \"Neptunian\" family, I will just add a brief sketch: Neptune is an inspiration and a deceiver, a musician and a dreamer, an addict and a liar, a drinker and a dealer, a tramp and a healer. \nI am one of three children of a woman born under a very tight Moon Neptune conjunction. A keen horsewoman when young, she yearned to become a doctor but had parents who did not believe in education for women. Her father inherited a shipping company, and her mother was an artist. She married a man who had only ever worked on the sea, and when he wasn't there, he was painting. During her lifetime, she had two boats named after her.\nMy siblings and I all have hard Neptune Moon contacts. My sister trained as a nurse, although her last job was as a chef on a trans-Atlantic yacht charter; she also volunteered on the inshore lifeboat (my mother raised the money to have this built). My brother has made and ridden surfboards all his life, although now he works mainly in a boat yard, and in his spare time, he is very involved with the local rowing club, another project my mother helped to found; his wife runs an organisation that looks after fisherman's welfare. Always \"cursed\" with an overactive imagination, I ran away from home at an early age and got involved with a different kind of life... exploring mysticism, divination and the unseen realms. My children reflect my 5th house Neptune, one with a Moon Neptune conjunction, the other, a  12th house Moon. Both are keen swimmers (I taught them both before they were 5), they also play music, and one has trained in social care; their father is a fishing guide. \n4\n2\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nLOL - wasn't it!?  A lot of fun but part of me wants to chalk that down to a practice event with an eye to a more global 24-hour event next year with a program of speakers - partnering with others, so it can roll right around the world and folks can dip in for an hour or two when the time zone swings round to them. I like the idea of everyone having a certain day to think about astrology and revive an ancient festival. We'll see - since then I've noticed some amazing Neptune events (and horasres), and I keep thinking \"that would be such a good piece to feature ...\nBut wow Joanna - what a backstory and interesting family history (and lineage) history you have. Your mother sounds like a perfect case study for the signature of Neptune in the natal, and she definitely passed that down the family line - strong Moon-Neptune aspects: no getting away from the sea for you lot ! LOL\n3\nLoad replies\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nWell sleuthed Joanna! :) - And in keeping with our theme - Claudia's Mercury is in a partile trine with her Neptune at 27 Taurus - and both make a trine to Wonder's Mercury at 24 Capricorn. So a lovely Mercury-Neptune ground trine there, with venus flowing into everything :)\n1\nJoanna Grant\n·\n2y\nI am just catching up on this, and have just listened to the story of Lady Wonder. It reminded me of one of our dogs, that my mother had, who always \"knew\" when my brother was returning home.... this was in the eighties and he was always on some surf safari or other to some far-flung destination.... and never communicated when he was to come back home. I decided that rather than the dog being \"psychic\" as my mother insisted, it was rather that the dog was aware of my mother's psychic abilities, which, with a Moon Neptune conjunction, she undoubtedly had. I thought it would be interesting to see the chart of the lady who reared the foal and who was her keeper. \n1\n3\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nWouldn't that be an interesting synastry comparison?

When you were talking about the need to set up a veil between oneself and the Neptunian sensitivity, it reminded me of this diorama in the Museum of Natural History in New York. It shows a Yakut shaman in Siberian healing a woman 'whose soul has been captured by malevolent spirits'. The shaman has an assistant (to the right) who is holding a chain around the shaman, so that he can find healing magic in the other world, but since this is a dangerous pursuit, the chain is to make sure that he does not fall into the other world and get trapped there. He has a healthy respect for the overwhelming, disintegrating power of that other world. You could extend the analogy to substance abuse (over-dosing, burnout, dopehead, fiend, junkie, stoner, zombie) You have to be careful when playing with spiritual or chemical fire.

        "text": "I enjoyed the book review.  My mother and I have had lots of conversations about the nature of astrological predictions, precisely along the lines raised by Mr. Little.  How \"firm\" is astrology?  Can you make predictions with scientific accuracy? Or is there a level of \"intuition\" (for lack of a better word) that must be added?  I believe it is the latter. Even though astrology has a certain unchangeable quality to it, since the march of the planets is absolute and was set in motion at the beginning of the universe, there is also the fact that any one transit can have dozens of possible interpretations or manifestations. As astrologers, we have to pick the interpretation that we will present to our clients, and that's where there is a certain... leap of faith.\n\nI was called into the world of astrology at the birth of my son, when one of my mothers friends purchased a birth reading for the new baby.  The astrologer made a prediction that today I find rather unethical. At very least, I would certainly never have the courage to make such a prediction.  He said \"this child will never be close to his father.\"  That statement shocked me to my core, because I was secretly contemplating divorcing my then-husband.  There is no way anyone could have known that, and there is no way I could have known that after the divorce my ex would leave the country and abandon us.  He stops by to see the children every few years, if he feels like it, but it's true, my son is not close to his father.  The astrologer's prediction, while dire, was correct!",

When I was doing that regularly, I realised that most people wanted happy reports and it was a constant dilemma of how to put over what I could read into the chart, or what to mention at all.  I was always perfectly comfortable with 'in person' consultations, but what I like about horary is that I have something specific that someone has asked me to look into.  I don't like the feeling of venturing beyond what I have been tasked with - because how far do we go and when do we stop?  An in person consultation gives you a sense of that, otherwise I would always be inclined to veer on the safe side and \"first do no harm\".  Kirk's review was certainly a thought-provoking read.",

        "text": "Yes, definitely was thinking of gay issues here – suddenly struck with horror at the thought of someone getting the wrong end of the stick there and thinking I might have meant that to apply to immigrants (like, the immigrants are taking over). Since I have spotted a typo on the following page I am going to muse on whether to amend that, to remove all possibility of being misunderstood. I think the UK Government's plans to send immigrants to Nigeria are horrendous and shameful, and that until all nations realise the need to invest in the deeper, underlying issues of sharing world resources more effectively all societies will remain blighted with bigger issues that screw us all anyway (the debilitating effect of war being one of them).  Same with the prison systems, same with our approach to climate issues.  Politics nowadays seems all about making the surface look shiny and getting things to work well on the current shift, without enough thought of the humanity issues and what the next shift has to inherit.\nAll I meant with the gay issue is - not that minority groups are no longer the minority - but they are less minority than before; increasingly finding their feet as an active normalised part of society. I think that is what Wade is pointing to too. This is quite a contrast to how life was when I was younger – a sense of stigma was very present then so gay people felt constantly concerned with being outed. The story I had in mind was the Christian wedding web designer gaining the right to pick and choose her clients according to their sexual orientation – bizarre situation and an attitude that I hope will simply grow/die out as the younger generations keep gaining strength in freedom of expression to be what they are. Of course, all of this is messy, when alongside that the world stage is still carrying news of homosexuality remaining a very dangerous lifestyle in certain countries.",

Huge thanks to Jason, Mireille, Abigail and Kirk (and all subscribers for making this possible)\nAs usual, I have attached a low resolution PDF copy to this post (4MB), but the high resolution copy is not very big this time (25MB), so really don't bother with that low res issue - you can view as a flipbook, download at any time, or grab the free ISSUU digital copy code from the members area at  https://www.skyscript.co.uk/patron/news.php\nOr go straight to the high-res flipbook it in fullscreen here:\nhttps://issuu.com/sta_astrology/docs/skyscript_newsletter_11_1e3a7fb592b9ae?fr=sZDZkYTYyNjY5MzA \nThere’s some really fascinating and thought provoking material in this one – if any of it stirs you, feel free to use this thread to discuss this issue’s content.\nThanks for your wonderful support!\n-  Deb\nAttachments\nDownload all\nSkyscript_newsletter_11.pdf\n30 comments\nThis comment has been removed.\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nI was listeing to a British political podcast this week and they mentioned Tucker Carlson having a plan to interview President Putin - this was discussed as if it would be quite a scoop, with Carlson being ideally placed to have the liberty and connections to do that.  I assumed that was widely known info, so I didn't bother to note it at the time.\n1\nLoad replies\nSheila Roher\n·\n2y\nI too enjoyed the book review- and Abigail, what a powerful example about the astrologer's reading of your son's chart! (what was the aspect the astrologer was looking at, do  you think? Sun/Saturn? Sun/Uranus?) Also I really appreciated your article on melothesia! So glad you laid out some of the variances in interpretations. I\n4\nAbigail Joy\n·\n2y\nI enjoyed the book review.  My mother and I have had lots of conversations about the nature of astrological predictions, precisely along the lines raised by Mr. Little.  How \"firm\" is astrology?  Can you make predictions with scientific accuracy? Or is there a level of \"intuition\" (for lack of a better word) that must be added?  I believe it is the latter. Even though astrology has a certain unchangeable quality to it, since the march of the planets is absolute and was set in motion at the beginning of the universe, there is also the fact that any one transit can have dozens of possible interpretations or manifestations. As astrologers, we have to pick the interpretation that we will present to our clients, and that's where there is a certain... leap of faith.\n\nI was called into the world of astrology at the birth of my son, when one of my mothers friends purchased a birth reading for the new baby.  The astrologer made a prediction that today I find rather unethical. At very least, I would certainly never have the courage to make such a prediction.  He said \"this child will never be close to his father.\"  That statement shocked me to my core, because I was secretly contemplating divorcing my then-husband.  There is no way anyone could have known that, and there is no way I could have known that after the divorce my ex would leave the country and abandon us.  He stops by to see the children every few years, if he feels like it, but it's true, my son is not close to his father.  The astrologer's prediction, while dire, was correct!\n4\n3\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThat's a profound story Abigail - thanks for sharing.  Yes, it would be a shocking thing to read -TBH that is one of the reasons I don't like doing natal astrology for clients.  When I was doing that regularly, I realised that most people wanted happy reports and it was a constant dilemma of how to put over what I could read into the chart, or what to mention at all.  I was always perfectly comfortable with 'in person' consultations, but what I like about horary is that I have something specific that someone has asked me to look into.  I don't like the feeling of venturing beyond what I have been tasked with - because how far do we go and when do we stop?  An in person consultation gives you a sense of that, otherwise I would always be inclined to veer on the safe side and \"first do no harm\".  Kirk's review was certainly a thought-provoking read.\n3\nLoad replies\nWade Caves\n·\n2y\nHi Drums – I took that comment to mean that the phrase 'minority' may be one of those intractable labels that aren't questioned or re-considered, even as demographics (religious, ethnic, racial, socioeconomic) shift into new shapes. I.e., at what point is a group allowed to be a solid demographic, and not just relegated to a minority?\n\nI was reminded of this article by The Hill – https://thehill.com/latino/4063595-texas-is-now-a-majority-minority-state/ – \"Texas is now a majority-minority state\". The first line gives an indication as to what that means – \"Hispanics are the largest demographic group in Texas, outnumbering non-Hispanic white people for the first time since the mid-19th century, according to U.S. Census data.\" By the numbers, Hispanic residents are now the ethnic majority in Texas; so why not call them the majority? Why the label 'majority-minority'? Isn't 'majority' fitting enough? It's a curious thing which brings in themes of intersectional oppression, and, in this case, distinctions drawn by having a federal + state system (Hispanic = nationwide /minority/, despite Texas state /majority/).\n2\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nWell, yes, quite. I don't like the idea of putting irrtetractable labels on anything - or the idea of labelling at all, to be honest (unless it is part of astro-technique and then my Taurean sense of \"Tradition ... Tradition ....\" kicks in :)). There's just me, and then there is everybody else in the world that is not quite me, so you are all a little strange and take a bit of getting used to.\n1\nCollapse replies\nDrums\n·\n2y\nI'm only on the intro & it's already thought provoking! :) I'm wondering who the minorities are that are no longer minorities? The links shared point to the gays. As a very gay gay, that's defo not my experience. There's a difference between a group no longer being a monitory and being co-opted by politicians and the media to appear that way. Curious where you're getting this from?  \"These typically concerned the rights of immigrants or ‘minority’ groups (increasingly not so minority),...\"\n1\n3\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nYes, definitely was thinking of gay issues here – suddenly struck with horror at the thought of someone getting the wrong end of the stick there and thinking I might have meant that to apply to immigrants (like, the immigrants are taking over). Since I have spotted a typo on the following page I am going to muse on whether to amend that, to remove all possibility of being misunderstood. I think the UK Government's plans to send immigrants to Nigeria are horrendous and shameful, and that until all nations realise the need to invest in the deeper, underlying issues of sharing world resources more effectively all societies will remain blighted with bigger issues that screw us all anyway (the debilitating effect of war being one of them).  Same with the prison systems, same with our approach to climate issues.  Politics nowadays seems all about making the surface look shiny and getting things to work well on the current shift, without enough thought of the humanity issues and what the next shift has to inherit.\nAll I meant with the gay issue is - not that minority groups are no longer the minority - but they are less minority than before; increasingly finding their feet as an active normalised part of society. I think that is what Wade is pointing to too. This is quite a contrast to how life was when I was younger – a sense of stigma was very present then so gay people felt constantly concerned with being outed. The story I had in mind was the Christian wedding web designer gaining the right to pick and choose her clients according to their sexual orientation – bizarre situation and an attitude that I hope will simply grow/die out as the younger generations keep gaining strength in freedom of expression to be what they are. Of course, all of this is messy, when alongside that the world stage is still carrying news of homosexuality remaining a very dangerous lifestyle in certain countries.\n2\nLoad replies\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n2y\nOoh yes 👍 happy Solar return great newsletter !

It has everything: research and trivia; current events and ancient history; newly translated classic text, scope of the month ahead, loads of timely charts to explore and diet advice to boot!\n\nAs usual, I have attached a low resolution copy to this post, but – as ever – my Virgo Moon begs you to remember that the best viewing experience is gained through the high-resolution issue you can view as a flipbook or PDF, or download, from the members area at  https://www.skyscript.co.uk/patron/news.php\nOr you can go straight to it in fullscreen here:\nhttps://issuu.com/sta_astrology/docs/skyscript_newsletter_9?fr=sZTgxMDYwNzIwNDk\nDo remember to check into the member’s area regularly to see what’s available there.  You can easily access all the past issues, grab a copy of Griffin on Theft, and check the list of upcoming talk dates.\nYour username is the email address that you use for this Patreon account\nThe password is (all lower case): regio\nThanks again to the contributors – Abigail – Dru – Jason - Joni – and Tanja – and also to Morgan for helping with the design concept of the Gemini logo.\nIf any of the content stirs you, feel free to use this thread to discuss this issue’s content.\nThanks for your wonderful support!\n-  Deb\nAttachments\nDownload all\nSkyscript_newsletter_9R.pdf\n12 comments\nKealoha Cristiano\n·\n2y\nAloha,\n\nGreat issue. \nNote: the access code link is not working (as of now, it can not be downloaded onto the issue account).\n\nMay you have a beautiful day,\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nThanks for letting me know this Cristiano - I realise I made a mistake and included a code with expiration limitations, but I have fixed that now so it should work fine.

All the shenanigans we struggled through while Mercury was retrograde were worth it. :D\nThe art is breathtaking! That's Morgan's work, correct?\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nI do the layout graphics within the articles but the cover design was fittingly dualistic.  I couldn't get anywhere with my ideas for Gemini, so I asked Morgan to take a look.  He came up with a great concept, which I then adapted a little to complete and incorporate the image of Mercury and some extra effects. Morgan is doing the next one for Cancer - haven't seen it yet, looking forward to that and so grateful for his artistic eye.\n1\nCollapse replies\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n2y\nPS : the girls have very much enjoyed reading your Gemini pdf 👍\n2\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n2y\nYay!! :)\nCollapse replies\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n2y\nWell every newsletter just improves on the previous one and this one is no exception !\nwhat a cracker !

In my last message, I mentioned that my husband and I were recovering from some kind of flu-type virus infection –  just as we thought we were getting over the worst of that, we both took ill again and discovered we had covid.  (We had prided ourselves on thinking we had managed to escape that one!)  So it has been a debilitating/frustrating month all round – my husband has been worse than me, but we both seem to be on the road to recovery now.  I am still not quite myself yet; my energy levels (and ability to focus) are still low and I find that after a few hours of work at my desk I crash very suddenly and need to rest.  But every day gets a little better, so I am confident that I will be back to my usual self by the end of next week.\nI had expected to announce an extra astrology discussion this month, but since I’ve had a non-functioning brain, I haven’t been able to do that.  I'm sorry about that. As soon as I am firing on all cylinders again I’ll get back on track with everything. For now, the next event I have planned is the talk about Ursa Major and the Pole Stars that I’ll be delivering at 4pm UTC on Saturday 29th April (full details in the member’s area).

As you said the Pluto opp Jup/Uranus in the 1789 chart has reignited another ‘revolution’ !! \n2\nLoad replies\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n3y\nInterestingly the chart for the 5th Republique (which would count as the one for the various governments since - 28/09/1958 Paris 6pm) has Uranus at 15° Leo so a nice T-square with Macron's in Scorpio and the current opp to Uranus in Taurus!... also, all current planets are in opposition to the stellium in 7th in the Rep's chart.  It is indeed a true picture of the current deep bipolar division of France, and the revolution feel of the period!\n2\nJoanna Grant\n·\n3y\nThe Aries ingress prior to him assuming power in 2017 has a Moon-Saturn conjunction within a degree or two of his Sun-Mercury conjunction. \n3\nJoanna Grant\n·\n3y\nPluto is currently opposing the Jupiter Uranus conjunction in the chart of the French National Assembly set for Versailles in 1789; in fact Macrons natal chart picks up quite a few of the positions in that chart. \n2\n2\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n3y\nInteresting Joanna   There are a lot of references going on about 1789 at the moment - thank goodness Macron chose to postpone the visit of King Charles as too many reference to royalty already ! It’s already very much « let them eat brioche » at the moment without adding a King into the mix !!\n2\nLoad replies\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n3y\nMerci beaucoup Deb xx très touchée par ton ajout !! Yes he’s going through it at the mo as is the rest of the country. The best headline I saw recently was in Le Monde when they were discussing the Jupiterian attitude of Macron ruling from above - quite fitting for a Sagittarius ♐️ also that Saturn opp is describing very well that he is seen as a remote out of touch president whose stance is seen to be fuelling the fire 🔥 (that’ll be his natal Mars 7th I guess) - and quite literally as well !  Other headlines say he is crystallising all the rage against him - the power of opposition aspects in action. Thanks from a grateful Frenchie 💕😘\n2\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nI'm actually glad that you gave the reminder to turn our attention there !\n1\nCollapse replies\nTheodora Vasilopoulou\n·\n3y\nMerci beaucoup !

At the moment I am not entirely satisfied with their offering - hence I haven't promoted it and I'm in two minds whether to leave that issue up or take that issue off.  But I have learned a lot in the process, for sure.  I'll be getting back to Amazon next week to ask if some hiccups can be overcome.  And I will explain more about the prospect of this to subscribers shortly - as soon as I'm a bit more informed. In the short term I suggest you don't purchase a copy from them - but - your morale boost, really lifts me - thanks!!!",

I do not ever even mention it because it's a very mathematically built language where every syllable has an effect on the meaning and where there were no punctuation marks, so it's pretty easy to misunderstand things (modern Greek has evolved but there is a huge amount of words that remain the same and being a native gives you an advantage). You are so right about the translations including interpretations. As we cannot speak every single language, we should all be very cautious, tolerant and flexible. Much love to you",

And all so resonant to the Mars in Gemini theme: teachers, postal workers, firemen, train drivers, public servants, ambulence drivers  .. just a few that come to mind.  Undermining everything is the issue of inflation.  \nThe ingress for Paris has Mars ruling the 1st and 6th house, with Mars in Gemini in the 8th house and Jupiter (disposed by that Mars) on the 6th house cusp.  So the idea of workers rights being affected is a major mundane theme for France just as it is for us here in Britain.",

Let’s not allow A.I and social media to take over!\n3\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nThanks Gary, and ditto the point about AI and social media :)\nCollapse replies\nTheodora Vasilopoulou\n·\n3y\nHello Deb, I am watching the recording as I couldn't join you last night . For what it's worth, I am Greek and have studied Ancient Greek for 3 years. I do not ever even mention it because it's a very mathematically built language where every syllable has an effect on the meaning and where there were no punctuation marks, so it's pretty easy to misunderstand things (modern Greek has evolved but there is a huge amount of words that remain the same and being a native gives you an advantage). You are so right about the translations including interpretations. As we cannot speak every single language, we should all be very cautious, tolerant and flexible. Much love to you\n4\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nThanks Theodora, great to get your view on this.\nCollapse replies\nEmma Gardiner\n·\n3y\nRegarding Martin's comments on the houses and signs as separate charts in Indian astrology, is there anywhere that I can read about this in more detail? If Martin isn't here, I can post this in the Skyscript forum. Thank you again for opening up this topic, it's connected me and I'm sure many others to more information on this than ever before. It's all been and continues to be very illuminating!\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nMartin has an associate membership to Skyscript, which means he gets the newsletters and announcements but doesn't get access to this Patreaon area.  But Skyscript would definitely be the better place for that sort of question anyway. There is a thread that concerns his paper and if you post the question there I am sure he will give an answer as soon as he can (sometimes takes a day or two but he is pretty good at answring all queries about his work).\n\nhttp://skyscript.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=11894\n1\nCollapse replies\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n3y\n😂😂 thanks for a great talk tonight and it was excellent to hear Martin explain his paper / where  he was writing from.  Glad we boosted your spirits- you deserve it all as you boost and have been boosting our learning all these years !! (France is all Saturn Mars - strikes over pension age 😂😂😂\n1\n2\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nIt is pretty amazing how many strikes we have going on in Britain right now - haven't seen anything like it since the Thatcher era. And all so resonant to the Mars in Gemini theme: teachers, postal workers, firemen, train drivers, public servants, ambulence drivers  .. just a few that come to mind.  Undermining everything is the issue of inflation.  \nThe ingress for Paris has Mars ruling the 1st and 6th house, with Mars in Gemini in the 8th house and Jupiter (disposed by that Mars) on the 6th house cusp.  So the idea of workers rights being affected is a major mundane theme for France just as it is for us here in Britain.\n2\nLoad replies\n\n\nWatch the videos you love from anywhere.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nVimeo\nFor those who missed Wade Caves’ presentation on Fortuna\nFor anyone who wasn’t able to attend Wade’s talk Finding Fortuna on Thursday 9th October, the recording is now available here in this post.\n11 October\n10\n3\nThis video uses Vimeo’s DNT parameter.

        "text": "On second Saturn returns. Brad Pitt has recently emerged from his second Saturn return which is a big deal for him as Saturn at 19° Aquarius is his chart’s ultimate dispositor. \n\nHe has Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars in Capricorn. Saturn rules his 2nd and 3rd houses. Under December’s Full Moon in Gemini, straddling his Sagittarius-Gemini Asc-Des axis, the front page of the FT Weekend announced that Pitt’s independent production company, Plan B (how Capricorn a name is that!) was acquired by France’s Mediawan for more than $300mn.

Really great to see you and keep in touch as we explored the more heavier aspects of Saturn and Capricorn (with a dash of merriment here and there).  I thoroughly enjoyed reading the comments in the chat box afterwards - here's a few that are too good not to immortalise:\n\nFrom Theodora Vasilopoulou to Everyone:\n\"« Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all » it takes a lot of Saturn lessons to fully understand that.\"\n\nFrom Jason to Everyone:\n\"I work outside- every change seasonally, is palpable, if you're there for it\"\n(Jason also shared that some Capricorns have 6 fingers ;))\n\nFrom West McDonough to Everyone:\n\"As Death says in Sandman: « You get what everyone gets: you get a lifetime”\n\nAnd last (but not least):\n\nFrom Sheila Roher to Everyone:\n\"happy (Saturnnalia) holidays to all!\"\n\n- I second that, wholeheartedly!\n\nDx\n8 comments\nBarbara G.\n·\n3y\nWow! Thanks for that link :)\n1\nLeena Chauhan\n·\n3y\nOn loneliness. The lyrics to ‘Being Alive’ from the musical ‘Company’ by Stephen Sondheim, owner of a Capricorn Moon, exquisitely capture the agony of Capricorn isolation.\n\nFirst three verses below, followed by a link to a performance of the whole song by Bernadette Peters.\n\nSomeone to hold you too close\nSomeone to hurt you too deep\nSomeone to sit in your chair\nAnd ruin your sleep\n\nSomeone to need you too much\nSomeone to know you too well\nSomeone to pull you up short\nTo put you through hell\n\nSomeone you have to let in\nSomeone whose feelings you spare\nSomeone who, like it or not\nWill want you to share\nA little a lot\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RJssHQjaZHg\n2\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nThanks x\nCollapse replies\nLeena Chauhan\n·\n3y\nOn second Saturn returns. Brad Pitt has recently emerged from his second Saturn return which is a big deal for him as Saturn at 19° Aquarius is his chart’s ultimate dispositor. \n\nHe has Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars in Capricorn. Saturn rules his 2nd and 3rd houses. Under December’s Full Moon in Gemini, straddling his Sagittarius-Gemini Asc-Des axis, the front page of the FT Weekend announced that Pitt’s independent production company, Plan B (how Capricorn a name is that!) was acquired by France’s Mediawan for more than $300mn. Pitt will be paid half in shares and half in cash. \n\nThis deal speaks to Pitt’s maturity as a businessman and a creative. Mediawan’s chief executive describes the Oscar-winning Plan B as ‘the best independent producer in the US, so I wouldn’t have wanted anything else to help us grow’. After making it big as a leading Hollywood sex symbol, Pitt began producing films inspired by his own artistic vision and ambition. He’s embodying the Capricorn goat-fish and now it’s paying off big time for him.\n\nCompare pictures of how Pitt looked in his heyday and how he scrubs up now.

I got a message through the system saying that you had edited your 2nd tier pledge from £15 per month to £162.01 per year.  Now why they have added that extra penny I do not know - 12 x 15 is £180, minus 10% is £18, so that means the one-year subscription with the 10% discount is £162. So this seems correct except for a stray penny.\nRemember this is British pounds which will be converted to your own currency - and also remember that VAT is added to the charge, which I wish I could avoid, but can't. But I presume the system explains that.",

It actually came as a shock to me, when I set this account up in July, to realise that people get charged more than the advertised subscription price because of the VAT (value added tax). Annoying! ... unless it helps you to realise you are supporting the British tax system too, and, no, I don't suppose it does (!)\nCollapse replies\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nHi Gary - firstly, thanks for the show of support which is very appreciated.  I got a message through the system saying that you had edited your 2nd tier pledge from £15 per month to £162.01 per year.  Now why they have added that extra penny I do not know - 12 x 15 is £180, minus 10% is £18, so that means the one-year subscription with the 10% discount is £162. So this seems correct except for a stray penny.\nRemember this is British pounds which will be converted to your own currency - and also remember that VAT is added to the charge, which I wish I could avoid, but can't. But I presume the system explains that.\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nDo let me know if you are happy with that - if not, message me privately and I'll see if there is a way to reverse the payment.

I have also attached a copy to this post so you receive it by email too!\n\nI did most of the work on this text over 10 years ago, but apart from a handful of private horary students, who received it between 2012-2014 as part of their coursework, it has never been made publicly available before today. It is definitely an interesting text to read - be sure to check out the appendices at the end of the book, where I add some thoughts on why I suspect Lilly could have been the author, writing under a pseudonym, and add some extra historical charts on this theme.\n\nHopefully, this will give you all something interesting to peruse until the newsletter circulation is resumed next month.\nDeb\nAttachments\nDownload all\nGriffin_Houlding_ISSUU.pdf\nTags\nHorary\n6 comments\nLara van Zuydam\n·\n3y\nJust to say that this text is incredibly helpful.

    "full_content": "Just a thank you - from me to you :)\nSkyscript\n27 Oct 2022\n27\n9\nI know I have said this before (and maybe irritatingly so), but I really do want to thank each and every one of you for supporting this project, and I want to give you my assurance that every penny raised through the Patreon project goes towards the development of Skyscript – and will not pay for private holidays to Seychelles or anything like that! Without your support, I would not be able to do the thing in life that I love the most – which is to spend time making Skyscript a really beautiful and worthwhile website to visit. I am paying myself an hourly rate at the UK living wage rate, and using funds raised to pay other contributors at the national average wage – knowing that every one of them is contributing for the love of the art, and not for money. The situation being new, things are still borderline between funds raised and expenses incurred, so every one of you is a precious resource in allowing me to proceed with the plan I want to develop – and I am so grateful for the support you are giving me. (I am wondering whether to make budget details available to Patreons – if I do, it will be an annual thing, to keep demands on my time low).\nI want to give a special ‘thank you’ to my soul-level supporters who are really making a huge difference in keeping things afloat.  I am very aware that I have not given you much by way of added benefits to justify your extra expense, but hope to rectify that shortly – bear with me for now (the last couple of months have been *very* busy, but things are starting to normalise - which feels great!).\nWhatever your level of support, I really do thank you, from the bottom of my heart.\n9 comments\nAquila Aurata\n·\n3y\nDelighted to have just discovered your project, Deb! For me, the relationship between you and your supporters is best based on trust, in which case financial statements do not enter the picture. I don't believe anyone here would be worried about where exactly the funds go since the newsletter and other benefits received far outweigh the cost of membership. And probably everyone would agree with me that your time is better spent on, well, astrology! Thank you for all you do! :)\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nThank you - and so great to see you with us here Peter!\n1\nCollapse replies\nHilary Spiteri\n·\n3y\nI missed your teachings Deb. So as soon as I could afford it I signed. We do all need more quality astrology with a critical eye. And definitely more art in this world.\n3\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nI am so grateful for your support Hilary and to see you here!

My son had a great sense of wit, as well as a great sense of humour.\n\n11 comments\nAurora\n·\n3y\nOh... I am so sorry. Glad for the wonderful dream! But so very sorry for your loss. I have a son serving overseas; I pray a lot. ;)\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nThank you Aurora - blessings to you son to keep him safe.

What a gift.\n2\nNina Gryphon\n·\n3y\nDeborah, it feels almost as if your son was using the image of Oscar Wilde to make that dream connection with you, taking you back to the trip to Oscar Wilde's house you both took. That's why you bought him the coat in the dream -- it was you making the connection between some of the details of Wilde's life and that of your son. How lovely and moving.\n5\nEmma Gardiner\n·\n3y\nWow what an interesting dream! I really value your openness, Deb, thank you for sharing this with us.\n2\nSamantha Blackadder\n·\n3y\nThank you for the moving dream share Deb 🤍✨️ It's a heart healing moment to realise our beloved dead are not that far away at all.\n\nAstro wise, as I read this, I noticed Oscars L9 - Venus is now conjunct his Sun, and the nodes are activating his Uranus/Mercury opposition in the 9th/3rd house. Seems you were sharing a dream with Oscars spirit!\n2\nLeena Chauhan\n·\n3y\nWhat an encounter for you, and for you to share with us.\n\nAnd such a vivid illustration of the magic of a softer, more allowing gaze over fixating on a chart and almost demanding revelation.\n4\nJeanette Han\n·\n3y\nSo beautifully expressed and filled with so much love. It's a gift when that drowsy feeling comes over us and we don't resist it. Instead, we meet our loved ones and feel the connection that's always been there. Our busy minds and lives need to shut down for a moment so they can slip through and share their love once more 💛 Thank you for sharing your personal experience, it was tender and filled with joy too. \n5\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n3y\nWhat an amazing and very moving share Deb :) Thanks as always for your trust in us and for opening up so honestly.  It goes to show how flimsy the veil is between our waking and sleeping worlds.  And also how those who have sadly moved away from us are still there.  Warmest thoughts to you.\n5\n\n\n\n\nRead more from your favourite creators.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nNew article – Wade Caves on ‘Finding Fortuna’\nAs a follow-up to the recent member presentation Wade Caves gave on whether or not it’s necessary to reverse the Part of Fortune by night, h\n22 October\n3\n0\nVimeo\nFor those who missed Wade Caves’ presentation on Fortuna\nFor anyone who wasn’t able to attend Wade’s talk Finding Fortuna on Thursday 9th October, the recording is now available here in this post.\n11 October\n10\n3\nThis video uses Vimeo’s DNT parameter.

I too share the love/hate relationship with social media but if I think back to my first exposure to astrology as a child it was probably from the regular media, which in today's day could have easily have been social media. Since then I've discovered some great astrologers through YouTube, I just had to separate the wheat from the chaff. I also think we have a great responsibility to continue to fill social media with real astrology because I really believe that if the good astrologers continue to promote and share their work, the right people will find them - I even found the STA through a hashtag on Instagram! Now look at what a lovely community I'm a part of :)\n\nI also just want to say that I don't think it's essential to use social media to work as an astrologer if you're able to promote yourself effectively in person. Most of my work so far has come from in person connections. \n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/_EmmaGardiner (I've decided to give Twitter a go again)\nhttps://www.instagram.com/emmafromarcadia/\n4\n4\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\n\" I really believe that if the good astrologers continue to promote and share their work, the right people will find them\".

Thanks for showing us, and in advance of it happening too, through the connections between the upcoming full Moon and the UK Libra ingress charts for London.\n\nThere's more to come. Mercury trines Pluto on Friday for the third time, just as Pluto stations direct on the eve of the Aries Full Moon. In the full Moon chart for London, Mercury is on the cusp of the turned 8th house of debt, while Pluto is on the radical 8th cusp. Maybe some kind of revelation about how much trouble our currency and financial system really are in surfaces? The heavy Pluto accent coupled with the Mars-ruled culmination of the lunar cycle suggests it won't be pretty whatever it is.\n\nAlso for the third time, next Wednesday, Mercury at 1° Libra opposes Jupiter at 1° Aries. As Mercury conjoins the Libra ingress Sun, the opposition lines up with the 5th-11th axis house cusps of the London full Moon chart. After party conference season is over and MPs are 'back to school', Parliament may well have a lot more to say on the terrible mess we're in.\n\nMercury stationed retrograde at 8° Libra. Both the PM and the Chancellor have Pluto at 6° Libra. It seems getting into No.10 and No.11 Downing Street, their respective official addresses, went to their heads. \n\nI recall watching Liz Truss being proclaimed the winner of the Tory Party leadership contest. She didn't even acknowledge her husband who was sitting right next to her. Even Oscar winners embrace their plus ones! Truss was too transfixed by the stage she was about to climb on to notice her hubby. Upon gaining office, Kwasi Kwarteng fired the most senior civil servant in the Treasury and ignored pretty much everybody else, including key institutions, before announcing his 'KamiKwaze' budget. The resulting 'thumbs down' in red lights from the financial markets led to a massive loss of power for sterling as a currency, echoing the background Mercury-Jupiter and Mercury-Pluto transits.\n\nMercury stationing direct in Virgo requires attention to be paid to process as well as money. The headline-grabbing reversal of the decision to scrap the tax cut for the highest earners was followed by a quieter, administrative decision to provide an Office for Budget Responsibility report, showing the figures behind the budget, after all. Kwarteng's initial rejection of the need for any such report meant there were no detailed numbers backing up his proposals which contributed to spooking the markets. Mercury resuming forward motion in a dual sign shows that more than one decision needed to be turned around.\n\nTrouble for the UK Treasury in 2022 is indicated in the UK Aries ingress too. The 11th-house ruling Moon at 29° Libra is heading for a steep decline as she hovers on the edge of Scorpio, and in square to Pluto in the turned 8th house.",

I believe they had some temporary server issues which I hope have been cleared now.\nBut please note that I have also attached the newsletter to this post as a reduced-size PDF file, which I recommend you download to keep.  The chart images are not so crystal clear in this, but it is a much smaller PDF file so won't take up much space on your system.\nI really hope you enjoy this - there is lots of fascinating material for you to plough through in the month ahead.\nAbsolutely love to get your feedback on the content of the newsletter if you have any comments to share.\nAttachments\nDownload all\n3_skyscript_Sep22_news.pdf\n5 comments\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n3y\nAnd like Jason very grateful for the unearthed Lily’s casebook !

    "full_content": "Ready for the ingress?\nSkyscript\n21 Sept 2022\n14\n5\n\n Hi everyone,\n\nI'll be circulating the next issue of the Skyscript newsletter in a couple of days.  There is so much 'good stuff' in this one that you might want to get ready for our Libran ingress theme by reading the article on the symbolism of Libra, which has now been polished up and given a voice-over by 'Queen of Hearts' Danielle Ashley  (thank you Danielle!).\nhttps://www.skyscript.co.uk/libra.html \nAlthough I realise that no seasoned astrologer lacks understanding of the Sun-signs, this article goes a little deeper into the origin of the symbolic principles than most. Both the article and the newsletter this month will balance that pretty pinkness of Venus with a reminder that the shadow of Saturn is never far behind in this sign.\nI am enjoying getting the newsletter finalised - more from me later.\nBest wishes\nDeb\n\n\n5 comments\nSarah McCulloch\n·\n3y\nLove it Deb!

I think the querent is dead for several reasons.  As a Leo AC he is signified by the peregrine Sun in Gemini.  His cosignifier the Moon is combust and peregrine.  Combustion symbolizes death.  The Moon phase is balsamic, the Moon in her last gasps of light before being extinguished. Saturn, the grim reaper on the cusp of the AC is also a symbology of death.  The last aspect was a trine from malefic Mars in domicile and the next aspect is a square from Venus in domicile which rules the 3rd house of communication. Venus translates the light from the cusp of the 8th house to The Sun is in a partile quincunx with Jupiter in Scorpio on the cusp of the 4th house of the grave.  Quincunx's move you into a new situation and Jupiter is often present in death charts. By the end of writing this I think he is alive again and just went out for milk and ran off.

For example, Venus is recorded at 18.37 Leo int eh historical image, not 17.34 as shown here.

Jupiter, ruler of the eight is in poor condition on the 4th cusp, end of matters. Jupiters benefic qualities are not present under such circumstances (no dignity in Scorpio, and retrograde).

However I read through the delineations others made and saw Deb mention that in the historical chart Venus was not applying to Saturn but separating, this changes the timing so I would judge the man to likely have died in some type of captivity, maybe away from his hometown because the Asc lord is peregrine!\n2\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nThank you to everyone who has commented here - I am going to reveal the known outcome to this in a couple of days and then move on to a second detail in the horary - so if anyone still has thoughts to share, be aware that I'll be posting the 'spoiler' soon.\n3\nCeleste F Brooks\n·\n3y\nIn true Mercury Rx I have gone back and forth on dead or alive.  Started with dead and am going back to it with my original judgment.  I think the querent is dead for several reasons.  As a Leo AC he is signified by the peregrine Sun in Gemini.  His cosignifier the Moon is combust and peregrine.  Combustion symbolizes death.  The Moon phase is balsamic, the Moon in her last gasps of light before being extinguished. Saturn, the grim reaper on the cusp of the AC is also a symbology of death.  The last aspect was a trine from malefic Mars in domicile and the next aspect is a square from Venus in domicile which rules the 3rd house of communication. Venus translates the light from the cusp of the 8th house to The Sun is in a partile quincunx with Jupiter in Scorpio on the cusp of the 4th house of the grave.  Quincunx's move you into a new situation and Jupiter is often present in death charts. By the end of writing this I think he is alive again and just went out for milk and ran off. I cant wait to read the whole story. \n2\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nHa ha - feeling your angst :)\n1\nCollapse replies\nWest McDonough\n·\n3y\nOf course, having already argued that it says he's dead, I'm reminded of the aphorism from Culpepper saying something like \"judge not rashly that the missing person is dead, he may be but drunk\" ;)\n2\nAMANDA WILLIAMS\n·\n3y\nAlive but everything seems to suggest close to death. Even though I wouldn't usually use a quincunx in horary- the Sun seconds away from the aspect to the 8th house ruler which is so close to the 4th house cusp, together with the moon ruler of 12th approaching the Sun suggests the matter will be resolved very quickly \n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nThere's some great observations in this thread! One thing I should have pointed out from the start - this chart wheel shows the closest computer match to the historical chart, so some of the positions in the wheel vary very slightly from what the 14th century astrologer recorded, as shown in the box below the image.  For example, Venus is recorded at 18.37 Leo int eh historical image, not 17.34 as shown here.  The newsletter will show both the historical chart and the modern computation - generally they agree very well.\npeter moodie\n·\n3y\nAlive, but in great danger health wise. (1)( Sun in the 10th house of medication, and visibility, with no aspect to the 8th house of death,but in detriment and Peregrin. (2.) Saturn ruler of the 6th house of sickness,and the 7th. of    enemy, and the south node in the 6th, is in detriment in the 1st by the 5deg    rule, conj.POF.,fortune is not favourable.  Moon co. significator and ruler of     the 12th house of imprisonment, self-undoing applying by conj. with sun.   Sun, and Jupiter retrograde (ruler of the 8th.)in mutual application by inconjunct, is hinting of problems that lacks clarity. A dignified Venus, ruler of the 10th(medication) and the 3rd(communication) applying by square to Saturn( maybe with lots of help danger can be averted.\n1\nKatarina Campagnola\n·\n3y\nSaturn, the ruler of the 7th as a representative of portal of death is on the ascendant, weak and debilitated. Mars, ruler of the 4th - end of things, has just squared Saturn (also ruler of sixth - possible accident on a journey (9th)?), and Venus, almuten ruler of the eight, strong and potent, is about to square Saturn. If he is not dead yet, he will be when Venus squares Saturn and the ascendent. The Sun does not have dignity, although Mercury is present in the same sign and dignified, but leaving the ruler of first, the Sun (not much help there). The Sun is strong in its position in the tenth house by placement, but the Moon applying to the Sun- and in its balsamic face, points to the end of a cycle and it is also going in to a weakened state of combustion. Jupiter, ruler of the eight is in poor condition on the 4th cusp, end of matters. Jupiters benefic qualities are not present under such circumstances (no dignity in Scorpio, and retrograde). The planets associated with death and accidents (mars and Venus in this case) are stronger, so  my guess is that the person is dead.\n2\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nSome good points here. \"Venus, almuten ruler of the eight, strong and potent, is about to square Saturn. If he is not dead yet, he will be when Venus squares Saturn and the ascendent\" - in the historical chart wheel Venus is recorded at 18.42, so the square to Saturn is very close but already past perfection (as the original astrologer understood it), but its square to the ascendant is still applying.\nCollapse replies\nDoug McIntosh\n·\n3y\nAlive. It seems strange to use L1 for the missing man, but assuming that is proper, I'd say judgment is given by the fact that neither L1 or the Moon (if we're going to give that to the missing man as a cosignificator) separates from aspect to Lord 8 (nor could it, as they and Jupiter are inconjunct). Also, Lord 1 is on the North Node by antiscion, which would seem to be a positive. \n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nI suspect this was a question asked about a person of importance - I did try to research around that time but there was nothing to be found to confirm that. But it doesn't seem that the question was asked by someone in an identifyable relationship with the missing man, because the historical principle, as explained by Lilly (CA, p.151) is “If a Question be demanded of one absent in a general way, and the querent hath no relation to the party; then the first house, the lord of that house and the Moon shall signify the absent party”.\nCollapse replies\nGloria Lorenzo\n·\n3y\nDEad:• Sun, the missing man’s significator, is peregrine, so he’s receiving no help. \n• Asc is in fixed Leo, so he’s motionless.\n• Malefic Saturn on ASC - strong by angularity, peregrine, and in detriment, making it especially malevolent - adding to the situation’s violence. \n• Almuten of the 8th, Venus is very strong (domicile, trip., angular, most elevated).\n• End of the matter/the grave Lord 4 is Mars in Scorpio, a death sign itself, L4 cinching the death conclusion. \n• L8 Jupiter (in Scorpio: death) moving away from 4th – death has already occurred.\n• Course of the question: Moon goes combust, then squares 8th cusp (death).\n1\nLoad more comments\nGet more out of every post with the app.\nOpen app\nRelated posts\nEnd of an era\nI have been following, demonstrating and considering the queen’s chart for the whole of my life as an astrologer.

    "full_content": "Skyscript Newsletter, Vol II\nSkyscript\n24 Aug 2022\n9\n2\nHi everyone,\nI am very excited to share the second edition of the Skyscript newsletter, which is hot off my desk.\nApparently, this is not the solstice and the Sun did not stand still as I hoped it would, to allow me distribute the newsletter *before* it made its ingress. What I lack in deadline delivery skills I hope I make up for in content delivery.  There is some really good stuff in this month’s newsletter, with a nice variety of content to give everyone something to enjoy with a cup of tea.\nI have attached it as a reduced size PDF file for those who prefer a straightforward download.  If you'd rather view it as a flip book, you can get free access on the ISSUU site by going to the following address and entering the access code below:\n\nhttps://issuu.com/store/publishers/sta_astrology/issues/skyscript_aug_22_newsletter_2/code/CKYCMKSY\nCKYCMKSY\nI will be opening up poll post shortly to solicit your feedback on the AG mystery detailed in this issue.\nEnjoy!\nDeb\n\nAttachments\nDownload all\nSkyscript_Aug22_newsletter_2.pdf\nTags\nnewsletter\n2 comments\nNina Gryphon\n·\n3y\nThanks, Deborah!

A\n24 Jun 2023\n19\n2\nSkyscript Newsletter #11 (August 2023) is out!\nIt’s a rarity, but wait long enough and a month comes along with a Blue Moon in it, and I manage to get ahead of a deadline :)  The August\n21 Jul 2023\n11\n30\nI want to thank you, again - your support has enlivened and enthused me,  and I am bursting with creative excitement – loving all the potential for creating a more ‘discerning’ reservoir of astro-info on the web. This is to let you know about one particular project I am working on, and to give you exclusive access to some of its content. I am currently partnering with Morgan Le Gall to improve the appearance and resources on the page that gives David McCann’s biography of Julius Firmicus. David McCann was a very unassuming yet talented classical scholar, a perfect gentleman who had pursued a life-long study of the history, theory and practice of astrology. I lost contact with David in the late 1990s and since he was an elderly man when I was young, I doubt I will be able to regain contact with him again. After Jean Rhys Bram’s English 1975 translation of Firmicus’s  Mathesis  had been many years out of print, David took it on himself to retype the whole manuscript, in the hope that I would keep it in circulation through the small print publishing company I ran at the time (Ascella Publications).  As a classicist he was already very familiar with its content - he had learned his own astrology from a Latin edition of this work, so, in the process of retyping, he corrected various errors and made several rearrangements and improvements to Bram’s original text, whilst I worked on a new layout, did the final editing and indexing, and created new diagrams.  I sought, and was given, permission by Jean Rhys Bram to publish the new edition.  Sadly, within just a few years I needed to dispose of Ascella publications for health reasons, and very shortly afterwards the Ascella edition dropped out of print too. Since I no longer have any digital files, I am in the process of scanning and editing a hard copy, to recapture this text once again.  Having acquired a little knowledge of Latin myself in the interim, I am also seeing places where amendments or additional footnotes could be helpful. I will be including several chapters on Skyscript – which will be serialised over time, starting with book II, which lays out the basic concepts. Book I will not be included on Skyscript (at least not in the foreseeable future) but I am including a copy of that chapter here as a 15-page PDF download for Patreons who would like a copy. Note – there is no practical astrology in book I of the  Mathesis  – this acts as a Preface which presents arguments against contemporary critics and sceptics of astrology. The points of dispute are considered quite important for anyone wishing to understand or research the historical setting and development of astrology because Firmicus holds a remarkably severe Stoical stance which rejects free will in favour of determinism.  Because of the influence of this work, it is often claimed that all ancient astrology was deterministic, which was not the case in reality. In our first Skyscript discussion meeting to be held over Zoom (details to follow in the newsletter), I will open up exploration and discussion of the issue of fate and freewill in historical sources, and as part of that, I will be looking at some of the comments made in this chapter.   That’s all for now – as this is my very first email to Patrons, I am keeping my fingers crossed that this circulates just as it should!

I too go with the overwhelming of the mind and loss of control of the situation even if jealousy, anger and vengeance are there too. A natal Venus in Scorpio in 10th disposited by that Mars 1st Sag square Uranus is unlikely to feel kindly at being betrayed. However I think that her natal Saturn in 8th in Virgo, triggered by the Sun squaring it on her disappearance - anguish of the mind on overdrive, as it is already a Virgo's natural tendency to worry and analyse -  and also Tr Saturn slowly coming to the square of it also shows the upcoming breakdown/death of her established world. Neptune natal square to her Saturn, as well as Neptune rising on her disappearance shows that she may indeed have chosen to escape (drugs like you mention ) and then somehow found it hard to get a grip back on both the reality and the situation (however temporary).

I am still not sure whether the car incident was deliberate or truly an accident, I am inclined to think a genuine accident that happened because she was upset, but I think she decided that it would serve a purpose when it happened. She may well have intended to go away to the hotel before the accident - it just changed her means of getting there?

    "full_content": "Aspectarian for August\nSkyscript\n27 Jul 2022\n13\n10\nHi everyone\nAn aspectarian for August - attached as a PDF file. You'll get good value from this by looking at the two lunations of the month and the major themes coming up.\nAugust strikes me as quite a challenging and unsettled month.\nIt is dominated by Uranus in many ways, and I note that the upcoming Mars-Uranus conjunction, which perfects on 1st August, is the only non-lunar conjunction of the month.\nThe full Moon in Aquarius on 12th August is certainly not the easiest lunation, with the Moon conjunct Saturn and squaring the Mars-Uranus conjunction.  Since the sign of Leo is associated with thunderstorms (said to be the lion roaring) I expect the weather will be quite unsettled with maybe periods of thunderstorms & hail, &c.  Hopefully no earthquakes!\nIf anyone would like to venture any thoughts of your own, please do.\nAttachments\nDownload all\nSkyscript_Aug_aspectarian.pdf\n10 comments\nLeena Chauhan\n·\n3y\nHere are three more signs of the month's turbulence:\n- Stationary Uranus squares the full Moon degree throughout the month.\n- Mars begins August in square to the full Moon, ends it in square to the new Moon, and is peregrine both times.\n- At the full Moon, Venus disposes the Mars-Uranus conjunction in opposition to where Pluto will enter Aquarius. \n1\n4\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nThanks for that extra Leena.

This is to let you know about one particular project I am working on, and to give you exclusive access to some of its content. I am currently partnering with Morgan Le Gall to improve the appearance and resources on the page that gives David McCann’s biography of Julius Firmicus. David McCann was a very unassuming yet talented classical scholar, a perfect gentleman who had pursued a life-long study of the history, theory and practice of astrology. I lost contact with David in the late 1990s and since he was an elderly man when I was young, I doubt I will be able to regain contact with him again. After Jean Rhys Bram’s English 1975 translation of Firmicus’s  Mathesis  had been many years out of print, David took it on himself to retype the whole manuscript, in the hope that I would keep it in circulation through the small print publishing company I ran at the time (Ascella Publications).  As a classicist he was already very familiar with its content - he had learned his own astrology from a Latin edition of this work, so, in the process of retyping, he corrected various errors and made several rearrangements and improvements to Bram’s original text, whilst I worked on a new layout, did the final editing and indexing, and created new diagrams.  I sought, and was given, permission by Jean Rhys Bram to publish the new edition.  Sadly, within just a few years I needed to dispose of Ascella publications for health reasons, and very shortly afterwards the Ascella edition dropped out of print too. Since I no longer have any digital files, I am in the process of scanning and editing a hard copy, to recapture this text once again.  Having acquired a little knowledge of Latin myself in the interim, I am also seeing places where amendments or additional footnotes could be helpful. I will be including several chapters on Skyscript – which will be serialised over time, starting with book II, which lays out the basic concepts. Book I will not be included on Skyscript (at least not in the foreseeable future) but I am including a copy of that chapter here as a 15-page PDF download for Patreons who would like a copy. Note – there is no practical astrology in book I of the  Mathesis  – this acts as a Preface which presents arguments against contemporary critics and sceptics of astrology. The points of dispute are considered quite important for anyone wishing to understand or research the historical setting and development of astrology because Firmicus holds a remarkably severe Stoical stance which rejects free will in favour of determinism.  Because of the influence of this work, it is often claimed that all ancient astrology was deterministic, which was not the case in reality. In our first Skyscript discussion meeting to be held over Zoom (details to follow in the newsletter), I will open up exploration and discussion of the issue of fate and freewill in historical sources, and as part of that, I will be looking at some of the comments made in this chapter.   That’s all for now – as this is my very first email to Patrons, I am keeping my fingers crossed that this circulates just as it should!

    "full_content": "Skyscript Newsletter I: Leo, Jul22\nSkyscript\n24 Jul 2022\n14\n19\nHi everyone\nI'm excited to be sending out the first Skyscript newsletter, which is attached as a PDF file. I had tried to make it appear fully formed in an email, but the formatting was too complex and that proved impossible.  But I think it works really well as a PDF.\nI hope you enjoy it - lots of Skyscript news and a few substantial pieces that have been written exclusively for Skyscript patrons.  I aimed to give you something meaty to chew on regarding the Sun and Leo as we spend the next month basking in that sign.\n\nIf you have any comments or constructive feedback please add them into this post. I look forward to catching up with some of you soon at the first Zoom meeting - details on page 7 of this file.\n\nAll the best for now\nDeb\nAttachments\nDownload all\nSkyscript_Jul_22_newsletter_1.pdf\n19 comments\nSarah McCulloch\n·\n3y\nRiver’s voice though! So perfect for Leo!

The Sun in Leo is shining full on through your glorious work of art. And I've only skim read it. Cant wait to hear from you and to meet the others on the launch call. Our hearts are gonna burst...\n3\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nYes, I am looking forward too.  I think have discovered a way to get it out to you all in more mobile friendly formats too, so will be adding an extra post about that shortly - once I've figured out the finer details.\nCollapse replies\nCROSSLEY Mireille\n·\n3y\nThanks so much Deb, what a treat ! I knew this would not disappoint because having followed Skyscript for years I have always been in awe of the knowledge you possess and above all that wonderful attitude towards sharing it in a way that makes it accessible to all. Hope Bertha and Betty get boosted along the way 👍🤗 \n1\n3\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nThanks Mireille - I'm really happy to know it is well received. I did worry that I might come across as a bit of a crazy woman, but took comfort in knowing this first issue was going out to people who are all good friends and already know that I'm a bit crazy (in a good way) anyway :)\nLoad replies\nJoanna Grant\n·\n3y\nA fabulous newsletter Deb, so much there, all explained so clearly in a way that makes the information so accessible. What a fabulous way for this Leo to move into Leo season!. Listening to River read the story of Leo was a fabulous treat, what a leonine, regal and statesman-like voice he has!!. Very well done, and looking forward to getting these every month. :) \n3\n2\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nI thought exactly the same about River Joanna - he \"channelled it\" didn't he?  I think it is a really wonderful concept to be creating a recorded collection of voices from astrologers of our generation too - especially the ones who are who sharing with each other - true members of the community. I am so pleased you enjoyed it - thanks for the feedback!\n2\nLoad replies\nSarah McCulloch\n·\n3y\nOh my goodness Deb. What pure juiciness to dive into. I can’t wait. You definitely don’t do anything half-assed do you?\n1\n1\nSkyscript\nAUTHOR\n·\n3y\nTaurean Sarah - our asses are very full and well set :) LOL\n1\nCollapse replies\nLiam Sofias\n·\n3y\nThis is incredible!

I lost contact with David in the late 1990s and since he was an elderly man when I was young, I doubt I will be able to regain contact with him again.After Jean Rhys Bram’s English 1975 translation of Firmicus’sMathesishad been many years out of print, David took it on himself to retype the whole manuscript, in the hope that I would keep it in circulation through the small print publishing company I ran at the time (Ascella Publications).  As a classicist he was already very familiar with its content - he had learned his own astrology from a Latin edition of this work, so, in the process of retyping, he corrected various errors and made several rearrangements and improvements to Bram’s original text, whilst I worked on a new layout, did the final editing and indexing, and created new diagrams.  I sought, and was given, permission by Jean Rhys Bram to publish the new edition.  Sadly, within just a few years I needed to dispose of Ascella publications for health reasons, and very shortly afterwards the Ascella edition dropped out of print too.Since I no longer have any digital files, I am in the process of scanning and editing a hard copy, to recapture this text once again.  Having acquired a little knowledge of Latin myself in the interim, I am also seeing places where amendments or additional footnotes could be helpful. I will be including several chapters on Skyscript – which will be serialised over time, starting with book II, which lays out the basic concepts.Book I will not be included on Skyscript (at least not in the foreseeable future) but I am including a copy of that chapter here as a 15-page PDF download for Patreons who would like a copy.Note – there is no practical astrology in book I of theMathesis– this acts as a Preface which presents arguments against contemporary critics and sceptics of astrology. The points of dispute are considered quite important for anyone wishing to understand or research the historical setting and development of astrology because Firmicus holds a remarkably severe Stoical stance which rejects free will in favour of determinism.  Because of the influence of this work, it is often claimed that all ancient astrology was deterministic, which was not the case in reality.In our first Skyscript discussion meeting to be held over Zoom (details to follow in the newsletter), I will open up exploration and discussion of the issue of fate and freewill in historical sources, and as part of that, I will be looking at some of the comments made in this chapter.That’s all for now – as this is my very first email to Patrons, I am keeping my fingers crossed that this circulates just as it should!Deb",

I had tried to make it appear fully formed in an email, but the formatting was too complex and that proved impossible.  But I think it works really well as a PDF. I hope you enjoy it - lots of Skyscript news and a few substantial pieces that have been written exclusively for Skyscript patrons.  I aimed to give you something meaty to chew on regarding the Sun and Leo as we spend the next month basking in that sign. If you have any comments or constructive feedback please add them into this post. I look forward to catching up with some of you soon at the first Zoom meeting - details on page 7 of this file.

This message gives a welcome from me and explains how to access all the resources, and what your password is, etc. I make sure I message everyone as soon as I can - always within 24 hours of joining us.  If anyone has not received a copy of that message by email, perhaps check you are not missing any important info by logging into Patreon (it could be that email copy of the message went to your email spam folder, but it will still be visible to you in the messages area of the Patreon site). I would be interested to know who didn't get this welcome message - because if the problem is affecting many people, I will give up on the message area and email directly instead.
