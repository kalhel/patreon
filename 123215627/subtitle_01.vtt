00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320
Welcome, this is the 14th Horoite Talk and this time the title is "Holo Lotta Lots".

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.360
And I will talk about the lots.

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.640
So the lots, which are very useful tools in astrology, at least there are some people

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.600
who say that they are very useful tools.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.800
And it seems that at the beginnings of Hellenistic astrology, lots

6
00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:36.327
constituted one of the three major tools to judge fields of life, topics of life and big

7
00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:42.467
questions of life, the various fields, various areas of life.

8
00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:45.787
One of these tools were the plants, of course.

9
00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:48.287
The other tools were the plants.

10
00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:57.395
the places or as we call them in modern astrology the houses and the lots were the third major

11
00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:06.675
tools that were used to judge different walks of life. But let's start with some definitions

12
00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:12.915
because I guess that this is very important to do this time. Yeah so what is a lot?

13
00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:16.095
A lot is a calculated point.

14
00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:24.095
So I would like to use my tool to be able to show you what I mean.

15
00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:27.095
Right, but here we go.

16
00:01:27.095 --> 00:01:28.095
So...

17
00:01:28.744 --> 00:01:40.704
Yeah, so, so the tool in this time, I would like to show you the definition for that.

18
00:01:40.704 --> 00:01:49.464
So the definition is that we have two astrological concepts like two planets, for example, and

19
00:01:49.464 --> 00:01:57.944
we measure the distance between these two planets or other concepts, and then we project

20
00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:08.113
the distance or the interval between them from the ascendant. So for example here we can see

21
00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:19.713
chart which was cast for my place exactly one hour ago so it was still

22
00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:30.148
diurnal chart. Now it should be a nocturnal chart. And for example if we measure from

23
00:02:31.348 --> 00:02:41.668
the sun to the moon, because these are the two constituent parts of the lot that we are

24
00:02:41.668 --> 00:02:45.108
we are looking for, then this

25
00:02:45.747 --> 00:02:53.587
the same distance should be projected from the ascendant to get the lot. Yeah in this case it is

26
00:02:53.587 --> 00:03:04.467
going to be the so-called lot of fortune. Yeah this is the best noun of all the lots a lot of fortune

27
00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:11.187
and this was as it seems that that was the the earliest of the lots and

28
00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:18.515
This calculation mathematically looks like this here.

29
00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:28.515
So we have the position of the moon, and from the position of the moon expressed in degrees, we subtract the position of the sun.

30
00:03:29.513 --> 00:03:39.693
In this way we get the distance from the Sun to the Moon in the zodiacal order and we project

31
00:03:39.693 --> 00:03:48.093
this from the ascendant by adding this interval or this result from the Moon.

32
00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:55.745
the degree of the ascendant. We have very good softwares to calculate

33
00:03:56.785 --> 00:04:03.345
the lots, very good programs online or programs that you need to pay for.

34
00:04:05.105 --> 00:04:08.705
But these can be problematic sometimes.

35
00:04:09.287 --> 00:04:17.787
because all these programs calculate the lots that are predefined by their developers.

36
00:04:17.787 --> 00:04:24.787
Sometimes they allow you to add your lots, but it is not always possible.

37
00:04:24.787 --> 00:04:31.787
Now, one more thing is that as I told you that the two constituent parts,

38
00:04:31.787 --> 00:04:36.787
so in here is B and C can be virtually anything,

39
00:04:37.002 --> 00:04:45.542
So they can be planets, they can be angles, they can be in later astrology, they can be

40
00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:58.962
place, cusps, lots, other lots, notable degrees of zodiacal signs, for example, the exaltation

41
00:04:58.962 --> 00:05:05.962
degrees of the sun or the moon or even degrees like the fifteenth degree of

42
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.470
of a cancer or a degree of a notable fixed star.

43
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.470
But A, the point from which we project the interval

44
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.470
is typically the ascendant.

45
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.470
Sometimes we find other points to project from,

46
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.990
but this is typically the ascendant.

47
00:05:28.392 --> 00:05:37.932
And one more thing is also important about the calculation is that whereas it seems to

48
00:05:37.932 --> 00:05:44.572
me that from the very beginnings the idea was to calculate the Lodz-Pied degree, at

49
00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:58.312
least on the theoretical level, until Ptolemaic tables became widespread in the world.

50
00:05:54.566 --> 00:06:00.566
Hellenistic astrology and used by astrologers.

51
00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:10.606
Astrologers hadn't had the opportunity, not always at least,

52
00:06:11.806 --> 00:06:14.566
to use precise tables.

53
00:06:14.975 --> 00:06:24.975
And so they had to rely on simplified calculations sometimes.

54
00:06:24.975 --> 00:06:28.975
That is, they had to calculate the lots only by sign,

55
00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:34.175
which is a very, very simple thing to do, actually.

56
00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:38.775
And it also seems that there were some lots that were

57
00:06:38.805 --> 00:06:49.805
specifically designed for becoming lots by sign only and not by degree.

58
00:06:49.805 --> 00:06:55.805
I will give you a couple of examples when the time comes.

59
00:06:55.805 --> 00:07:03.805
But if you would like to imitate this, you can do it very quickly.

60
00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:08.547
in a very simple way, very simple calculation.

61
00:07:09.827 --> 00:07:13.847
So for example, if I would like to cast

62
00:07:13.847 --> 00:07:16.267
the Lot of Fortune by sign,

63
00:07:16.267 --> 00:07:21.267
all I need to do is to start from the sun

64
00:07:21.767 --> 00:07:26.767
as if he is in the first place.

65
00:07:26.936 --> 00:07:33.136
Then I count down the signs from the Sun and if I just look at this chart

66
00:07:33.136 --> 00:07:37.796
I will discover that the moon is in the 11th

67
00:07:38.636 --> 00:07:40.636
place

68
00:07:40.776 --> 00:07:44.616
from the Sun so and in reality

69
00:07:45.616 --> 00:07:47.616
the Lot of Fortune will also

70
00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:54.815
fall in the 11th place from the ascendant. Yeah so that's very simple you see you look at the sun

71
00:07:53.336 --> 00:07:55.336
You

72
00:07:55.535 --> 00:08:04.815
you come down until the moon and you have you already have in which place from the ascendant

73
00:08:05.295 --> 00:08:09.215
the uh this indeed the lot by sign should fall.

74
00:08:09.395 --> 00:08:14.395
Okay, so but let's go on and let's see the next thing.

75
00:08:17.715 --> 00:08:20.715
Let's look at the origins of the lots.

76
00:08:24.075 --> 00:08:28.355
Because in this talk I would like to focus more

77
00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:31.075
on the origins and the historical developments

78
00:08:31.075 --> 00:08:33.115
and it's very important to see

79
00:08:33.115 --> 00:08:35.095
what the original ideas were.

80
00:08:35.053 --> 00:08:47.453
Now, as it seems, at least this is the impression that the surviving sources give me, that the

81
00:08:47.453 --> 00:08:53.213
idea of the lots, especially the idea of the lot of fortune,

82
00:08:53.647 --> 00:08:59.167
was developed by someone who used the pen name of

83
00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:07.647
pen name Necepso and composed the so-called book 13 of Necepso.

84
00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:14.127
Now when it happened is quite uncertain but it must have happened before

85
00:09:14.127 --> 00:09:22.127
um

86
00:09:15.113 --> 00:09:25.913
the first century BCE because we have some charts, birth charts surviving from the early

87
00:09:25.913 --> 00:09:35.553
first century BCE in which the Lot of Fortune is already used. Not only the Lot of Fortune

88
00:09:35.553 --> 00:09:42.913
but also the Lot of Fate which is a counterpart of the Lot of Fortune, it looks like a later

89
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:58.490
So I would say that this data suggests that maybe the idea was developed sometime in the

90
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:04.650
mid or early second century BC, but we are uncertain about that.

91
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:09.850
Why is it called the 13th book of Necapso?

92
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.850
Why?

93
00:10:09.964 --> 00:10:13.544
Well, we don't know.

94
00:10:13.544 --> 00:10:23.424
It is possible that there was an earlier corpus of text, astrological texts, to which a later

95
00:10:23.424 --> 00:10:33.504
book was added and the author behind the name of Nacapso was the one who developed the idea

96
00:10:33.504 --> 00:10:34.504
of a lot.

97
00:10:34.504 --> 00:10:39.504
Yeah.

98
00:10:34.898 --> 00:10:39.898
and exposed the idea of lots first time in this book.

99
00:10:43.978 --> 00:10:48.978
It also looks like there was a later book,

100
00:10:50.058 --> 00:10:54.778
a commentary composed by someone

101
00:10:54.778 --> 00:10:58.438
on this very next of let's say Necapso.

102
00:10:59.378 --> 00:11:01.698
And this was the

103
00:11:02.024 --> 00:11:11.864
work that bore the title "Horoi" or "Definitions" and it was ascribed to Petosiris.

104
00:11:12.504 --> 00:11:22.184
So we have really few sources, few fragments of these texts.

105
00:11:22.459 --> 00:11:29.739
And most of these fragments come from Vettel's Valence, so we don't really have the opportunity

106
00:11:29.739 --> 00:11:41.859
to compare different fragments and to see whether these texts that Valence had in the

107
00:11:41.859 --> 00:11:45.899
second century were genuine or they were...

108
00:11:45.966 --> 00:11:54.126
later versions of some earlier texts. But what we see is that these are the texts,

109
00:11:55.006 --> 00:12:03.726
Capsule's book 13 and Pastosiris' definitions, obviously a commentary on the former that speak

110
00:12:03.726 --> 00:12:05.646
about the Lot of Fortune.

111
00:12:05.939 --> 00:12:10.939
Now, what a Lot of Fortune or what general lots do?

112
00:12:12.939 --> 00:12:17.939
A Lot of Fortune itself is the indicator of bodily health

113
00:12:18.819 --> 00:12:23.819
and material prosperity, as I have here in the slide.

114
00:12:25.539 --> 00:12:30.539
So these are the primary meanings of the Lot of Fortune.

115
00:12:31.099 --> 00:12:33.559
And in the interpretation,

116
00:12:34.059 --> 00:12:48.939
astrologers looked at the place position of the lot. They also looked at in which sign it fell.

117
00:12:50.939 --> 00:12:58.699
And what is even more important that the domicile rulers or domicile lords of the lots

118
00:13:03.871 --> 00:13:17.871
the questions indicated by the issues indicated by the lots were positive in a given nativity or negative.

119
00:13:17.871 --> 00:13:27.871
So for example in this case if an astrologer looked at the lot of fortune,

120
00:13:27.871 --> 00:13:32.871
the astrologer could find that a lot of fortune fell into the 11th

121
00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:40.799
place which was in general a positive sign at least we can say that by falling into the

122
00:13:41.599 --> 00:13:54.959
into the place called good fate or good diamond it had very nice indications and for judging whether

123
00:13:56.872 --> 00:14:01.872
more positive indications or significations could be added.

124
00:14:01.872 --> 00:14:07.872
They looked at the domicile ruler that is the moon.

125
00:14:07.872 --> 00:14:11.872
In this case, as the lot falls in cancer.

126
00:14:11.872 --> 00:14:16.872
And they looked at the fact that the lord of

127
00:14:16.872 --> 00:14:19.872
the moon is the moon.

128
00:14:16.947 --> 00:14:25.907
the lot and the lot were. In opposition maybe that has indicated some tension but also they

129
00:14:19.872 --> 00:14:24.872
And they looked at the fact that the lord of the moon is the moon.

130
00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:34.307
looked at the other positions and aspects with other planets especially with the malefics.

131
00:14:35.427 --> 00:14:42.147
So that was the way how they judged these questions and as I mentioned Lot of Fortune was

132
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:57.200
especially wealth. But a lot of fortune was also used in different other techniques, including

133
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:06.680
techniques for assessing the length of life. And also some predictive techniques. For example,

134
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:15.480
the Vettius Valens says famous or notorious so-called zodiac releasing, which is a modern

135
00:15:15.967 --> 00:15:20.967
and in which the lot of fortune or its counterpart,

136
00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:25.767
a lot of fate was sort of released,

137
00:15:25.767 --> 00:15:30.767
sort of directed throughout the zodiac.

138
00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:41.487
Now, normally, we have a formula for the

139
00:15:40.448 --> 00:15:49.168
for a given lot like we have the formula I've already shown for a lot of fortune

140
00:15:41.487 --> 00:15:45.487
the

141
00:15:51.008 --> 00:15:58.608
but in some sources there are some indications that the formula should be reversed

142
00:15:58.608 --> 00:16:03.248
for knight charts or knight nativities or even knight inceptions.

143
00:16:03.868 --> 00:16:07.148
because for example, a lot of fortune was also used in Inceptions.

144
00:16:08.908 --> 00:16:15.468
Among others, it could be used for assessing the real intention of the Quarant.

145
00:16:16.908 --> 00:16:22.908
What this reversing means? Reversing means that here we have the formula,

146
00:16:23.448 --> 00:16:35.648
ascendant plus the moon minus the sun here. Now if we go for reversing we

147
00:16:35.648 --> 00:16:40.728
exchange the positions of them of the sun and the moon so we will go with

148
00:16:40.728 --> 00:16:47.408
ascendant plus the sun and the moon and of course all these positions are

149
00:16:47.408 --> 00:16:51.088
understood in degrees.

150
00:16:49.687 --> 00:16:59.927
I would like to address this question but first let's look at the source text of Nacapso

151
00:16:59.927 --> 00:17:08.007
in the format and it survived in the formats in the versions it survived to see whether

152
00:17:08.007 --> 00:17:08.407
it survived.

153
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:23.530
We can have any sort of ideas what he meant with the formula of the auto fortune.

154
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.530
So let's see what it says.

155
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:33.530
So one version is by Vettius Valens.

156
00:17:33.569 --> 00:17:43.569
who in book two and in book nine sort of quotes in a capsule.

157
00:17:43.569 --> 00:17:53.569
The interesting thing is that there are minor variations between the two quotations, which have the number text.

158
00:17:53.658 --> 00:18:01.098
33 and 34 in my collection of the capsule and petocirrhosis fragments.

159
00:18:04.698 --> 00:18:11.978
But these differences won't bother us very much because they don't really

160
00:18:13.978 --> 00:18:14.478
you

161
00:18:14.261 --> 00:18:22.821
attach or they are not really related to anything that can be headache for us.

162
00:18:22.821 --> 00:18:24.341
But let's see what it says.

163
00:18:24.341 --> 00:18:24.741
Okay.

164
00:18:25.301 --> 00:18:31.061
So what the text says is that the next in order, which is zodiacal order,

165
00:18:31.701 --> 00:18:34.661
for those born by day,

166
00:18:34.661 --> 00:18:44.181
[BLANK_AUDIO]

167
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:40.340
which is found in one variant in book nine,

168
00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.860
you will have to count accurately,

169
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.520
which means by degree, from the sun to the moon,

170
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.820
then to measure off or to make the variant text,

171
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:58.820
the same interval from the hour marker backward.

172
00:18:59.807 --> 00:19:04.807
And the variant text doesn't say backward, but it says "reversely".

173
00:19:05.807 --> 00:19:09.807
Okay, so what does this want from us?

174
00:19:10.807 --> 00:19:14.807
The counting goes in zodiacal order, that's okay.

175
00:19:14.807 --> 00:19:19.807
Or for a day birth, we count from

176
00:19:19.807 --> 00:19:24.807
from the day birth to the day birth.

177
00:19:20.728 --> 00:19:33.768
the from the sun to the moon okay and we measure off the same interval from the hour marker

178
00:19:24.807 --> 00:19:28.807
So, we count from the day birth to the day birth.

179
00:19:35.128 --> 00:19:41.768
but it says backward or inversely which would be something like this

180
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:46.449
Yeah.

181
00:19:46.449 --> 00:19:54.049
Now normally this is understood as referring to the nocturnal for the reversed formula.

182
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:55.049
Okay.

183
00:19:55.049 --> 00:20:04.469
Now if you look at the text you won't find any reference to nocturnal births.

184
00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:05.729
What it says here is...

185
00:20:06.157 --> 00:20:11.157
that you count from the sun to the moon

186
00:20:12.597 --> 00:20:17.597
and then you count reversely or backward

187
00:20:17.877 --> 00:20:19.197
from the hour marker.

188
00:20:20.597 --> 00:20:25.597
So what it suggests is that even the diagonal formula

189
00:20:27.037 --> 00:20:29.597
for the lot of fortune is wrong.

190
00:20:29.597 --> 00:20:34.597
So we should calculate from the hour marker

191
00:20:33.254 --> 00:20:43.754
the moon to the sun, which would be the easier way and to measure this in the zodiacal order.

192
00:20:43.754 --> 00:20:52.154
And we would get a lot of fortune and it would be a lot of fortune both by day and night.

193
00:20:52.154 --> 00:20:53.154
Yeah.

194
00:20:53.154 --> 00:20:54.554
Now this interpretation.

195
00:20:54.978 --> 00:20:59.978
would be valid solely on the ground of this text,

196
00:21:00.558 --> 00:21:04.838
at least as it stands now, right?

197
00:21:04.838 --> 00:21:09.838
But this would contradict to all the noun

198
00:21:12.198 --> 00:21:16.038
horoscopic examples that we have, actually,

199
00:21:16.038 --> 00:21:18.438
because in these horoscopic examples,

200
00:21:18.438 --> 00:21:21.798
what we see is that by day,

201
00:21:21.917 --> 00:21:28.997
the lot of fortune is calculated as the distance from the sun to the moon.

202
00:21:29.477 --> 00:21:34.797
And by night, this is calculated as a distance from the moon to the sun.

203
00:21:35.477 --> 00:21:35.877
Okay.

204
00:21:37.717 --> 00:21:45.997
Fortunately, we have another version which looks like not verbatim notation.

205
00:21:46.186 --> 00:21:51.186
but the paraphrases from Necapsus source text.

206
00:21:52.906 --> 00:21:57.906
This is preserved by the fifth or sixth century anonymous

207
00:22:00.706 --> 00:22:03.706
Neoplatonist commentary on Ptolemies Tetrabiblos.

208
00:22:08.124 --> 00:22:15.124
And what it says is that by day count from the sun to the moon.

209
00:22:15.124 --> 00:22:18.124
Okay, so far so good.

210
00:22:18.124 --> 00:22:25.124
And count down the same interval from the hour marker and toward the following signs.

211
00:22:25.124 --> 00:22:28.124
Okay, so all right.

212
00:22:28.124 --> 00:22:32.124
Here what we do is here we have this interval.

213
00:22:32.661 --> 00:22:34.821
right, and then we will follow the

214
00:22:36.141 --> 00:22:42.461
So that could order from descendant. So we come from here and reach a

215
00:22:43.101 --> 00:22:45.101
Lot of fortune. That's very good

216
00:22:46.141 --> 00:22:48.141
By night, of course

217
00:22:48.661 --> 00:22:50.661
We should do

218
00:22:51.141 --> 00:22:55.781
Something different because it says but by night reverse lay

219
00:22:56.305 --> 00:23:07.945
Okay. Now the question here is that, all right, so one thing is quite clear that there was

220
00:23:07.945 --> 00:23:18.905
an expression in the original wording that is read backward in Greek, "empalin" in some

221
00:23:18.905 --> 00:23:23.705
manuscripts and it was read reversely.

222
00:23:23.806 --> 00:23:35.806
or Annapalene in other manuscripts. Valens mentions both readings. The anonymous Neoplatonist

223
00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:45.246
on the other hand mentions only reversely Annapalene and he

224
00:23:46.388 --> 00:23:49.708
he comments Ptolemy's text,

225
00:23:49.708 --> 00:23:51.748
who says that in this case,

226
00:23:51.748 --> 00:23:56.748
reversely means going in the other direction in general.

227
00:23:58.028 --> 00:23:58.868
Okay.

228
00:23:59.988 --> 00:24:04.728
But at least, even if this version,

229
00:24:04.914 --> 00:24:17.914
is sort of problematic because it is not a verbatim quotation and also it just uses one possible reading, manuscript reading.

230
00:24:17.914 --> 00:24:27.914
It looks less corrupt than the first one because in this case we clearly see that there was some sort of distinction between

231
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:33.040
diurnal nativities and nocturnal nativities.

232
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.340
Maybe the thing is that Valens quotes

233
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.700
Necapsus' text with an omission.

234
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.940
So maybe what he means is,

235
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.900
"Next in order for those born by day,

236
00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.040
"you will have to count accurately from the sun to the moon

237
00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.920
"than to measure off

238
00:24:55.926 --> 00:24:59.626
the same interval from the hour marker,

239
00:24:59.626 --> 00:25:01.646
but by night, backward.

240
00:25:02.606 --> 00:25:03.806
Yeah.

241
00:25:03.806 --> 00:25:06.246
So if we compare the two texts,

242
00:25:06.246 --> 00:25:11.246
maybe this reading and also together with the other sources

243
00:25:11.306 --> 00:25:14.166
we have actual horoscopes.

244
00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:19.166
This sort of reading sounds more meaningful

245
00:25:19.286 --> 00:25:23.566
than the form we have in the violence is text.

246
00:25:23.526 --> 00:25:31.446
Okay, but from this we can have a number of options and at least it looks like

247
00:25:33.606 --> 00:25:40.306
Hellenistic astrologers had these number of options. So what can we do? What do we do by night?

248
00:25:40.926 --> 00:25:43.526
Reversing or no reversing? This is the big question.

249
00:25:44.406 --> 00:25:47.526
Right, so the majority opinion is

250
00:25:48.006 --> 00:25:55.446
that backward means that this time we don't count from the Sun to the Moon,

251
00:25:56.206 --> 00:25:59.886
but we count from the Moon to the Sun. Okay?

252
00:26:03.886 --> 00:26:11.766
And that's it. Yeah. Or we can also calculate it in the other way that backward means that

253
00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:24.111
Uh, we still calculate from the sun to the moon, but then this distance is measured backwards.

254
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:28.871
The result is the same.

255
00:26:31.271 --> 00:26:32.151
We will have.

256
00:26:33.032 --> 00:26:38.032
by night, we will have the sun in the third place.

257
00:26:40.912 --> 00:26:44.472
Now this chart that you see here is a nocturnal chart

258
00:26:44.472 --> 00:26:48.472
and this was made up for, this was cast for the beginning

259
00:26:48.472 --> 00:26:52.332
of my talk, for my position.

260
00:26:53.572 --> 00:26:56.752
So now the sun is under the horizon,

261
00:26:56.752 --> 00:26:58.652
of course this is nocturnal.

262
00:26:58.652 --> 00:26:59.552
So that's why

263
00:26:59.898 --> 00:27:06.898
We won't find the Lot of Fortune somewhere here, but we will find it here.

264
00:27:06.898 --> 00:27:16.898
Okay, so this is the majority option. This is what many astrologers, including Dorotheus,

265
00:27:16.898 --> 00:27:21.898
Valens, Apollos, Rhetorius, and others describe.

266
00:27:22.556 --> 00:27:32.556
And this is the version we also find in the actual horoscopes, which number to about 40.

267
00:27:32.556 --> 00:27:38.556
Yeah, so we have about 40 horoscopes using the

268
00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:50.556
[no audio]

269
00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:46.320
a lot of fortune and many of them are nocturnal horoscopes and in these nocturnal horoscopes

270
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:53.120
with some exceptions, yeah very few exceptions, we will find this reversed formula.

271
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.200
Okay but what is the other

272
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.220
um

273
00:27:58.953 --> 00:28:01.873
faction. What do they say?

274
00:28:03.593 --> 00:28:12.593
Dolomite says that reversely is a backward projection from the ascendant.

275
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.640
um

276
00:28:13.073 --> 00:28:18.073
So what we basically says is that, uh,

277
00:28:18.393 --> 00:28:19.233
we,

278
00:28:19.573 --> 00:28:23.493
sort of do everything in the other direction.

279
00:28:23.493 --> 00:28:27.933
So we come from the sun to the moon

280
00:28:27.933 --> 00:28:30.253
against zodiacal order,

281
00:28:30.253 --> 00:28:35.253
and we cast this distance again against zodiacal order.

282
00:28:36.813 --> 00:28:40.693
In this case, please ignore these blue

283
00:28:40.693 --> 00:28:44.293
and red lines circles here.

284
00:28:45.695 --> 00:28:50.695
So please only follow my lead

285
00:28:51.295 --> 00:28:55.415
because the other one can be distracting.

286
00:28:55.415 --> 00:28:58.455
This is also a valid calculation,

287
00:28:58.455 --> 00:29:02.335
but this is not what Ptolemy seems to suggest.

288
00:29:02.335 --> 00:29:07.335
What it says is that, okay, we do exactly what we do by day,

289
00:29:07.695 --> 00:29:10.195
but we go in the other direction.

290
00:29:10.364 --> 00:29:12.804
Yeah.

291
00:29:12.804 --> 00:29:20.044
Which means that finally, in fact, we

292
00:29:20.044 --> 00:29:25.724
will get the same results as in a diurnal horoscope.

293
00:29:25.724 --> 00:29:27.364
Now, this is not only--

294
00:29:29.013 --> 00:29:40.093
Pallamy who says this, although he is the most illustrious proponent of this idea.

295
00:29:40.093 --> 00:29:44.533
But actually the petoseries commentary says the same.

296
00:29:44.533 --> 00:29:52.693
So it says something like no matter in which direction you measure the direction, the interval

297
00:29:52.693 --> 00:29:55.133
from the sun to the moon.

298
00:29:55.133 --> 00:29:56.133
Uh.

299
00:29:55.826 --> 00:29:59.506
you will get the same results by day and night.

300
00:29:56.133 --> 00:29:58.133
Yeah.

301
00:30:02.626 --> 00:30:08.306
And there is a first century astrologer

302
00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:10.946
who we don't know anything about.

303
00:30:10.946 --> 00:30:13.746
But one thing that he cast a horoscope

304
00:30:15.023 --> 00:30:26.023
And this horoscope, he is said in a Nocturnal Horoscope that a lot of fortune fell into this and that sign.

305
00:30:26.023 --> 00:30:38.023
And this is the right position of the lot of fortune and not the one that the majority thinks that the lot of fortune is.

306
00:30:38.023 --> 00:30:44.023
And then this, and if we look at this horoscope, we will see that what he proposes that we should

307
00:30:44.801 --> 00:30:55.921
use the diurnal formula for nocturnal births as well. So basically we have the opposition

308
00:30:56.961 --> 00:31:03.281
in this question, the opposition which argues that we shouldn't

309
00:31:04.641 --> 00:31:09.921
um

310
00:31:04.864 --> 00:31:10.864
reverse the Nocturna formula for the Lot of Fortune. Now this is an important thing, right?

311
00:31:10.864 --> 00:31:18.384
Because a Lot of Fortune is an important part of the horoscope and as statistically speaking

312
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:12.961
um

313
00:31:19.184 --> 00:31:25.824
half of the nativities are Nocturnal and half of the Inceptions are Nocturnal.

314
00:31:26.464 --> 00:31:29.664
It is not insignificant whether the

315
00:31:30.035 --> 00:31:43.875
a lot of fortune falls say into cancer into the 11th place having the moon as its lord or it falls

316
00:31:44.515 --> 00:31:52.435
into scorpio having in the third place having mars as its lord.

317
00:31:52.644 --> 00:32:02.084
which can be in a completely different place of the horoscope. Now, I guess that you know that the

318
00:32:02.084 --> 00:32:09.924
modern people follow this lead or that lead, especially as Ptolemy's interpretation became

319
00:32:09.924 --> 00:32:15.604
widespread in the early modern European astrology, which

320
00:32:17.762 --> 00:32:29.442
wanted to go back to the astrologer's origins and discover that Ptolemy was one of the most ancient

321
00:32:32.002 --> 00:32:38.402
astrologers. Even they told that Ptolemy was a sort of an archetypical

322
00:32:39.658 --> 00:32:52.218
astrologer and whatever Ptolemy suggested like non reversing had to be followed or they

323
00:32:52.218 --> 00:32:58.898
thought that they had this these ideas should be followed so what we know that from let's

324
00:32:58.898 --> 00:32:59.898
say the.

325
00:32:59.898 --> 00:33:00.898
[00:16:29]

326
00:33:00.423 --> 00:33:18.223
15th or more likely from the 16th century on, unreversed lots of fortune was used and the

327
00:33:00.898 --> 00:33:01.898
[silence]

328
00:33:01.898 --> 00:33:02.898
[00:16:33]

329
00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:03.898
[00:16:34]

330
00:33:03.898 --> 00:33:08.898
[00:16:35]

331
00:33:18.223 --> 00:33:23.103
astrologers who followed this tradition were

332
00:33:23.103 --> 00:33:24.103
[inaudible]

333
00:33:23.815 --> 00:33:28.815
completely surprised when at the end of the 20th century,

334
00:33:24.103 --> 00:33:25.103
[00:16:29]

335
00:33:25.103 --> 00:33:26.103
[silence]

336
00:33:26.103 --> 00:33:27.103
[00:16:33]

337
00:33:27.103 --> 00:33:28.103
[end of audio]

338
00:33:28.103 --> 00:33:29.103
[00:16:39]

339
00:33:29.103 --> 00:33:30.103
[end of audio]

340
00:33:30.095 --> 00:33:33.535
there were people who started to discover medieval

341
00:33:33.535 --> 00:33:35.975
astrology, Hellenistic astrology,

342
00:33:35.975 --> 00:33:39.835
and started to use a reversed formula.

343
00:33:39.835 --> 00:33:41.895
So there are still people who say,

344
00:33:41.895 --> 00:33:46.175
one of some people say that, oh, for Nocturna charts,

345
00:33:46.175 --> 00:33:49.255
this is a very good idea to reverse

346
00:33:49.255 --> 00:33:52.015
because this is the original thing, it works for me.

347
00:33:52.226 --> 00:33:55.146
Others say that no, it shouldn't be reversed,

348
00:33:55.146 --> 00:33:56.626
and this works for me.

349
00:33:56.626 --> 00:33:57.586
Okay.

350
00:33:57.586 --> 00:34:01.706
Now this is always a big question that this,

351
00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:04.506
what we can do with this, this or if ideas.

352
00:34:04.506 --> 00:34:05.346
Okay.

353
00:34:05.346 --> 00:34:08.806
But if it is not enough,

354
00:34:10.466 --> 00:34:12.506
there is a third idea,

355
00:34:12.506 --> 00:34:17.506
which is Valence's attempt to fix this contradiction.

356
00:34:19.186 --> 00:34:21.226
And I think that's a good point.

357
00:34:19.216 --> 00:34:31.036
because he also quoting Nacapso and quoting the so-called Petosiris commentary, he sees

358
00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:39.976
that at least if we accept both of these texts, including Petosiris' text, that we are not

359
00:34:39.976 --> 00:34:44.976
supposed to reverse the formula by night.

360
00:34:44.976 --> 00:34:45.976
He tries to...

361
00:34:45.976 --> 00:34:48.976
[Pause]

362
00:34:46.825 --> 00:34:52.745
to find a compromise and he proposes that

363
00:34:56.145 --> 00:35:04.225
By night we should only use the nocturnal formula if the moon is above

364
00:35:05.405 --> 00:35:09.025
The horizon so is on is in the sky. Yeah

365
00:35:09.409 --> 00:35:12.889
Of course, the sun will be under the horizon,

366
00:35:12.889 --> 00:35:17.289
because this is the only way how the chart could be nocturnal.

367
00:35:17.289 --> 00:35:23.929
But if we find that the moon is also under the horizon,

368
00:35:23.929 --> 00:35:29.969
then we can say, all right, now the moon is invisible.

369
00:35:29.969 --> 00:35:33.169
So we could stay with the diurnal formula

370
00:35:33.169 --> 00:35:35.489
and not to change it.

371
00:35:35.489 --> 00:35:36.009
OK.

372
00:35:36.009 --> 00:35:36.969
This is very nice.

373
00:35:38.688 --> 00:35:47.928
uh, ingenious idea it would be. He even finds some, um, quite obscure passages, uh, about

374
00:35:47.928 --> 00:35:56.288
the sun's, uh, uh, uh, primary role in the, in, in controlling the universe, uh, to,

375
00:35:56.288 --> 00:36:05.048
to, to, uh, confirm his idea. Uh, but actually he never uses his own, uh,

376
00:36:05.565 --> 00:36:08.405
formula, hybrid formula.

377
00:36:08.405 --> 00:36:13.805
So he always goes with the normal diagonal formula

378
00:36:13.805 --> 00:36:18.525
and the reversed nocturnal formula.

379
00:36:18.525 --> 00:36:22.925
OK, so how can we get out of this?

380
00:36:22.925 --> 00:36:28.005
Maybe you say that, all right, this is not very important.

381
00:36:28.005 --> 00:36:30.445
I have my own preferences and things like that.

382
00:36:30.445 --> 00:36:30.965
But--

383
00:36:30.896 --> 00:36:35.616
No, I don't think that this would be a right thinking.

384
00:36:35.616 --> 00:36:39.736
What I think is that it's a very important thing to address,

385
00:36:39.736 --> 00:36:47.576
maybe the most important thing to address that, how could we

386
00:36:47.576 --> 00:36:51.776
look out of this mess?

387
00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:54.536
And how can we--

388
00:36:53.742 --> 00:36:58.742
If it is possible, how can we make meaning for lots?

389
00:36:59.842 --> 00:37:02.842
Okay, so let's see what we can consider.

390
00:37:03.962 --> 00:37:08.202
We can try to consider neck capsules intentions,

391
00:37:08.202 --> 00:37:12.202
which is not a very, very simple task

392
00:37:12.202 --> 00:37:17.202
as multiple witnesses states that neck capsules

393
00:37:21.771 --> 00:37:31.291
uh texts were obscure now we don't know whether the texts surviving under the name or

394
00:37:32.011 --> 00:37:39.131
circulating under the name of of nakhapso at the time were written by one person or not

395
00:37:39.131 --> 00:37:41.291
that's very unlikely basically

396
00:37:41.778 --> 00:37:53.058
What is likely is that maybe book 13 that discussed a lot of fortune and some more things

397
00:37:53.058 --> 00:37:54.698
were written by one person.

398
00:37:54.698 --> 00:38:01.818
This would be a really sensible hypothesis.

399
00:38:01.818 --> 00:38:02.378
But still.

400
00:38:02.806 --> 00:38:07.806
Even that book looks like it was obscure.

401
00:38:02.826 --> 00:38:32.126
but they are not interested in the

402
00:38:07.806 --> 00:38:12.246
And this obscuration was sort of intentional,

403
00:38:12.246 --> 00:38:15.606
which has a long tradition in astrology, right?

404
00:38:15.606 --> 00:38:20.606
So even Mesopotamian scholars added some remark

405
00:38:21.286 --> 00:38:24.806
at the end of the tablets that don't show it

406
00:38:24.806 --> 00:38:28.606
to the ones who are not initiated,

407
00:38:28.584 --> 00:38:30.384
But of course, if they are initiated,

408
00:38:30.384 --> 00:38:33.704
you can show the content to them.

409
00:38:33.704 --> 00:38:36.344
Now this can cause some headache for us

410
00:38:36.344 --> 00:38:43.744
because there are sometimes terms in Babylonian tablets

411
00:38:43.744 --> 00:38:45.504
that we just don't understand.

412
00:38:45.504 --> 00:38:48.104
So even if we understand the word itself,

413
00:38:48.104 --> 00:38:52.224
we don't really know what it refers to.

414
00:38:52.224 --> 00:38:55.784
Now the same can be true in some cases.

415
00:38:56.265 --> 00:38:58.785
for Necepso's ideas.

416
00:38:58.785 --> 00:39:03.785
Okay, so I will try my best to uncover

417
00:39:05.665 --> 00:39:07.745
the secret of Necepso's words,

418
00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:09.905
but of course this is not definitive,

419
00:39:09.905 --> 00:39:12.945
so some other solutions are also imaginable.

420
00:39:13.825 --> 00:39:16.105
Okay, we should also

421
00:39:17.571 --> 00:39:27.831
analyze or or to look closer look at this thing I'm a little bit more closer

422
00:39:27.831 --> 00:39:37.871
what I mean is what is the relation of fortune to the moon yeah because

423
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:42.990
It is often said in some forms that the formula,

424
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:45.931
you

425
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:49.630
the fortune is related to the moon.

426
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:54.590
Some sources it is even called the lot of the moon.

427
00:39:56.070 --> 00:40:01.070
Okay, we should also look at fortune's role

428
00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:06.700
as an alternative ascendant, which is Ptolemy's idea,

429
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:16.140
who calls fortune lunar ascendant

430
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.940
as opposed to the solar ascendant

431
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:23.400
that should be the ascendant itself.

432
00:40:23.552 --> 00:40:31.212
And we should also take a look at the Lot of Fate, which is called a Lot of Diamond

433
00:40:31.212 --> 00:40:33.412
or Lot of Spirit or something like that.

434
00:40:33.412 --> 00:40:41.172
A Lot of Genius, I also read that, which is sometimes posed as a solar counterpart of

435
00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:43.492
the Lunar Lot of Fortune.

436
00:40:43.921 --> 00:40:52.601
Okay, these are different things, different threads to do investigations upon.

437
00:40:52.601 --> 00:40:59.521
But even now you see that there is sort of, let's say, a minor contradiction between some

438
00:40:59.521 --> 00:41:03.481
understandings.

439
00:41:03.481 --> 00:41:11.001
There is Ptolemy who admits to fortune only.

440
00:41:09.756 --> 00:41:12.716
but rejects all the other lots.

441
00:41:16.436 --> 00:41:21.436
On the other hand there are some astrologers, and this is the majority basically,

442
00:41:22.836 --> 00:41:24.436
for whom

443
00:41:24.436 --> 00:41:28.276
there is fortune and there is this counterpart

444
00:41:29.196 --> 00:41:31.196
fate.

445
00:41:30.532 --> 00:41:50.532
And basically fate is what it would be a lot of fortune if it was a diurnal horoscope or vice versa.

446
00:41:50.532 --> 00:41:57.532
So basically the diurnal formula of a lot of fortune is used for a lot of fate and the nocturna

447
00:41:59.871 --> 00:42:08.111
by night and the Nocturne formula of the Lot of Fortune is used for a Lot of Fate by day.

448
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:21.711
Okay, but the contradiction here is that for Ptolemy, Fortune is the lunar ascendant and the

449
00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:27.391
real ascendant is the solar ascendant. So the lunar-solar opposition

450
00:42:27.731 --> 00:42:36.691
is framed, is established in this way. A contradiction or a sort of opposition between

451
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:46.211
fortune and the ascendant. Whereas whenever there is a solar counterpart,

452
00:42:47.014 --> 00:42:51.574
in the other sources, the solar counterpart is fate.

453
00:42:51.574 --> 00:42:53.814
So now there is another lot.

454
00:42:54.894 --> 00:42:59.854
Okay, now these are mutually exclusive

455
00:42:59.854 --> 00:43:02.034
understandings of the matter.

456
00:43:03.014 --> 00:43:04.734
And actually,

457
00:43:07.574 --> 00:43:11.534
this contradiction should be resolved in some way.

458
00:43:11.534 --> 00:43:12.374
So,

459
00:43:12.345 --> 00:43:17.345
whether we can join to Ptolemy in some ways,

460
00:43:17.545 --> 00:43:20.705
whether we can discard Ptolemy's views

461
00:43:20.705 --> 00:43:23.625
and go with the majority option.

462
00:43:23.625 --> 00:43:27.545
Okay, but let's see, let's go one by one.

463
00:43:27.545 --> 00:43:29.825
So let's start with the Capsule's intentions

464
00:43:29.825 --> 00:43:34.385
and let's go toward the solution as much as it is possible.

465
00:43:34.385 --> 00:43:35.225
Okay, so,

466
00:43:36.745 --> 00:43:37.585
uh,

467
00:43:37.779 --> 00:43:41.619
We have looked at the source text

468
00:43:41.619 --> 00:43:45.459
and what problems they pose.

469
00:43:45.459 --> 00:43:50.259
And also we have seen Ptolemy's ideas

470
00:43:50.259 --> 00:43:55.539
how this reverse lay should be understood,

471
00:43:55.539 --> 00:43:58.739
so that we are going toward the other direction.

472
00:43:58.739 --> 00:44:07.739
And we will find in a miraculous way

473
00:44:05.243 --> 00:44:09.843
Surprise, surprise, the same lot by night.

474
00:44:09.843 --> 00:44:12.283
So what can we do with this?

475
00:44:12.283 --> 00:44:18.883
My idea is that even if Ptolemy is right

476
00:44:18.883 --> 00:44:23.123
and even if we assume that Necepso was intentionally

477
00:44:23.123 --> 00:44:26.723
obscure, it sounds too much.

478
00:44:27.312 --> 00:44:36.392
So what point does it make to say that you need to do something differently by night

479
00:44:36.392 --> 00:44:41.632
if you actually don't do anything differently by night?

480
00:44:41.632 --> 00:44:47.632
So yeah, maybe you do the calculation differently.

481
00:44:47.986 --> 00:44:55.066
that, okay, you count in the other direction or something like that, but why is it important?

482
00:44:55.066 --> 00:45:09.026
So if I want to define a point, it is sort of pointless to distract.

483
00:45:09.445 --> 00:45:14.445
or to misdirect my readers into doubts in this way.

484
00:45:22.445 --> 00:45:27.445
So if we just look at Nacapso's intentions,

485
00:45:27.805 --> 00:45:32.805
we try to, at least I try to think with his intentions.

486
00:45:33.214 --> 00:45:45.214
add, then this inversely should direct us to reversing by night.

487
00:45:45.214 --> 00:45:54.334
So whatever this reversing means and in whatever form it should be imagined,

488
00:45:55.934 --> 00:46:01.774
the result is that by night we calculate from the moon to the sun and we

489
00:46:02.957 --> 00:46:10.957
we project this in this way or we calculate from the sun to the moon and we go backwards

490
00:46:10.957 --> 00:46:16.557
so basically we will have the same results yeah but at least we will have

491
00:46:18.877 --> 00:46:26.077
in this case we will have the lot of fortune under the horizon and not above the horizon

492
00:46:26.077 --> 00:46:29.917
as it would be if it was a diurnal chart

493
00:46:30.445 --> 00:46:35.445
Okay, so this is what we can derive from Necapso's words.

494
00:46:39.605 --> 00:46:43.645
What can we see if we look at the fortunes

495
00:46:43.645 --> 00:46:44.965
in relation to the moon?

496
00:46:47.165 --> 00:46:49.845
As I said that for Ptolemy,

497
00:46:52.865 --> 00:46:57.765
the Lot of Fortune is a sort of a lunar ascendant

498
00:46:57.765 --> 00:46:58.805
in the way

499
00:46:58.829 --> 00:47:08.069
That what the ascendant is for the moon is fortune

500
00:47:10.229 --> 00:47:15.589
Sorry, what is the ascendant for the Sun is fortune for the moon

501
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:25.629
Yeah, okay. Yes, so solar there is a solar ascendant and and the the Sun has a certain

502
00:47:27.006 --> 00:47:39.406
relationship with this ascendant. In this case what we see is that the Hassan is not in opposition

503
00:47:42.926 --> 00:47:47.726
anymore with the ascendant because it is already under the horizon.

504
00:47:48.353 --> 00:48:00.353
So we should have a point for the moon with which the moon has the same relation.

505
00:48:00.353 --> 00:48:02.353
And this will be here.

506
00:48:02.353 --> 00:48:11.353
So if this is the lunar ascendant, so to speak, then there would be a lunar descendant here.

507
00:48:11.464 --> 00:48:18.464
and this distance between the lunar descendant and the moon

508
00:48:18.464 --> 00:48:26.464
and the distance between the normal solar descendant and the sun would be the same.

509
00:48:28.464 --> 00:48:31.464
So if this idea is original,

510
00:48:32.308 --> 00:48:40.308
then we should say that there is no need for reversing by night.

511
00:48:40.308 --> 00:48:44.308
Otherwise it doesn't make any sense.

512
00:48:46.308 --> 00:48:54.308
Now, we don't actually know whether Ptolemy's idea is his idea or

513
00:48:54.308 --> 00:48:56.308
what he is thinking.

514
00:48:54.562 --> 00:48:57.202
this idea had already been there.

515
00:48:56.308 --> 00:49:00.308
We don't know.

516
00:49:00.282 --> 00:49:10.322
And the lunar attributes of fortune are not explicit in the

517
00:49:10.322 --> 00:49:17.682
Necapso text or even in the in the Petosavris commentary, or in

518
00:49:17.682 --> 00:49:22.442
any other texts, not defining but at least using the

519
00:49:23.352 --> 00:49:30.352
a lot of fortune in the writings attributed to Necephas and Petosiris.

520
00:49:31.352 --> 00:49:41.352
But we know that the Egyptian imagery that was related to fortune was deeply lunar.

521
00:49:42.352 --> 00:49:44.352
So it would be

522
00:49:45.296 --> 00:50:00.576
We can say that it is quite likely that fortune had some lunar characteristics.

523
00:50:00.576 --> 00:50:05.056
But actually, as it seems, the earliest text,

524
00:50:05.056 --> 00:50:15.056
the first text,

525
00:50:05.368 --> 00:50:21.128
that says this explicitly is a lost text that was ascribed to a otherwise unknown early figure called Abraham

526
00:50:22.888 --> 00:50:29.608
whose fragments are preserved by Firmicus Maternus and Vatius Valens

527
00:50:30.328 --> 00:50:32.568
and in passage

528
00:50:34.177 --> 00:50:48.617
extent in Firmicus, he says that the formula is the lot of the moon and fate is the lot

529
00:50:48.617 --> 00:50:50.697
of the sun.

530
00:50:50.697 --> 00:50:55.357
So what he seems to be alluding to is that

531
00:50:55.357 --> 00:50:57.357
the

532
00:50:56.918 --> 00:51:06.918
We don't know if this text is very early, but it might well be earlier than Dorotheus,

533
00:51:01.157 --> 00:51:03.157
the

534
00:51:06.918 --> 00:51:14.918
who is otherwise the earliest source for a lot of fortune and a lot of fate.

535
00:51:14.918 --> 00:51:18.918
But it's already by him.

536
00:51:19.384 --> 00:51:32.384
It was already conceptualized as sort of a pairing between a lunar and a solar lot.

537
00:51:32.384 --> 00:51:34.384
Yeah.

538
00:51:34.384 --> 00:51:44.384
So even if this is another tradition and Ptolemy's is a different tradition,

539
00:51:44.384 --> 00:51:46.384
it's still a tradition.

540
00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:57.510
we can still see that the lunar character of the Lot of Fortune seems rather plausible.

541
00:51:46.384 --> 00:51:48.384
So, yeah.

542
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:00.010
Yeah.

543
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:08.150
But let's focus on this question of a lunar ascendant a little bit more.

544
00:52:08.431 --> 00:52:22.431
And it is something that is not suggested only by Ptolemy but also by some other authors, especially by Valens.

545
00:52:22.431 --> 00:52:29.431
Because if you read Valens' book 2, you discover that

546
00:52:29.431 --> 00:52:34.431
the author of the book is not a real author.

547
00:52:30.076 --> 00:52:40.636
in the second part of book two, he defines an alternative place system that starts from

548
00:52:34.431 --> 00:52:37.431
He is a real author.

549
00:52:40.636 --> 00:52:52.756
the Lot of Fortune, which is more or less equivalent with the normal system of places

550
00:52:52.756 --> 00:52:55.476
that start from the Ascendant.

551
00:52:55.935 --> 00:53:07.375
He also adds that the 11th place from the Lot of Fortune has very important significations

552
00:53:07.375 --> 00:53:15.275
and he calls it a place of acquisition.

553
00:53:15.275 --> 00:53:20.415
But at least it looks like he already used the

554
00:53:20.071 --> 00:53:31.271
the Lot of Fortune as an alternative ascendant. Also, there is an earlier text, and this is

555
00:53:21.355 --> 00:53:25.355
the

556
00:53:31.271 --> 00:53:42.791
the text of Manelius, who in his book Three describes the system of so-called labors,

557
00:53:42.791 --> 00:53:45.491
which is like an

558
00:53:45.623 --> 00:53:58.783
alternative do decatropos in the sense that the 12 signs starting from the from fortune

559
00:53:58.783 --> 00:54:08.863
are given different meanings and these different meanings look like having been used.

560
00:54:09.497 --> 00:54:13.697
not in nativities, but perhaps in some

561
00:54:13.697 --> 00:54:17.697
exceptional astrology or general astrology.

562
00:54:17.697 --> 00:54:21.697
But at least what we see here in Manelius' text

563
00:54:21.697 --> 00:54:25.697
is that

564
00:54:25.697 --> 00:54:29.697
a lot of fortune is, again, is in sort of

565
00:54:29.697 --> 00:54:33.697
an alternative ascendant.

566
00:54:31.795 --> 00:54:48.995
So in some ways, we could still confirm Ptolemy's idea that there is a solar

567
00:54:33.697 --> 00:54:37.697
[silence]

568
00:54:48.995 --> 00:54:56.435
ascendant and this is contrasted in some ways with a lunar ascendant which is a lot of fortune.

569
00:54:56.670 --> 00:55:08.830
But the problem here is that all these authors, including Valens and Manilius, who build up

570
00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:18.830
a sort of an alternative place division system on the Lot of Fortune, reverse the formula

571
00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:18.990
of the Lot of Fortune.

572
00:55:19.454 --> 00:55:26.654
for the night, effectively making the nocturnal

573
00:55:26.654 --> 00:55:32.334
Bottle of Fortune solar, even if it is not set.

574
00:55:33.974 --> 00:55:35.574
But this is what we have.

575
00:55:37.014 --> 00:55:40.054
Yeah, this is what we have.

576
00:55:41.338 --> 00:55:46.338
Because in this case, if we go with the Nocturna formula,

577
00:55:50.378 --> 00:55:55.378
the relation of the moon to the ascendant

578
00:55:56.778 --> 00:56:01.778
will be the same as the relation of the moon to the moon.

579
00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:07.100
or identical to the relation between the sun and the Lot of Fortune.

580
00:56:05.698 --> 00:56:09.738
So, the relation of the moon to the ascendant

581
00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:14.780
So if you see here, you see that the distance of the moon from the ascendant is the same

582
00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:19.120
as the distance of the sun from the Lot of Fortune.

583
00:56:19.607 --> 00:56:20.607
Yeah.

584
00:56:20.607 --> 00:56:30.247
What it means is that by night the Lot of Fortune is not lunar at all.

585
00:56:30.247 --> 00:56:31.727
It is quite solar.

586
00:56:31.727 --> 00:56:36.867
Yeah, it is never set in any many sources.

587
00:56:36.867 --> 00:56:41.887
But it looks like this is the clear implication of the reversal.

588
00:56:42.394 --> 00:56:57.194
This also brings us back to the question whether the ascendant can be legitimately called solar.

589
00:56:57.194 --> 00:56:59.354
And I think the answer is yes.

590
00:57:03.535 --> 00:57:05.135
Something like, not really.

591
00:57:08.095 --> 00:57:11.695
Because what is the definition of the ascendant?

592
00:57:11.695 --> 00:57:15.335
So let's go back to the definition.

593
00:57:15.335 --> 00:57:17.655
Now I don't have a diagram for that,

594
00:57:17.655 --> 00:57:20.095
so it's just going to be something

595
00:57:20.095 --> 00:57:21.975
that you need to imagine.

596
00:57:21.975 --> 00:57:24.295
So what we have is that we have the horizon.

597
00:57:24.609 --> 00:57:29.609
And we have the ecliptic somewhere.

598
00:57:29.609 --> 00:57:39.609
Okay, so the ecliptic is like wobbling all around during the day, depending where you are on the surface of the Earth.

599
00:57:39.609 --> 00:57:50.609
But if you're lucky, at least one thing happens, there is an intersection between the horizon and the ecliptic.

600
00:57:50.669 --> 00:57:56.429
Yeah. Now this intersection is called the ascendant and this is calculated.

601
00:57:57.789 --> 00:58:06.269
In this case we have an intersection of two great circles but these are circles basically.

602
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:12.429
Now the ecliptic is the imaginary path of the sun

603
00:58:13.059 --> 00:58:18.059
So in this sense, the ascendant is pretty solar.

604
00:58:20.939 --> 00:58:25.939
Yeah, because otherwise, otherwise the zodiac

605
00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:30.679
is not a circle.

606
00:58:30.925 --> 00:58:35.925
But the belt, it has a certain width, right?

607
00:58:37.685 --> 00:58:42.685
We can define this as a constant, let's say 60 degrees,

608
00:58:44.445 --> 00:58:46.365
like eight degrees toward the north

609
00:58:46.365 --> 00:58:48.325
and eight degrees toward the south.

610
00:58:49.525 --> 00:58:53.205
Because whatever happens in our lifetime,

611
00:58:53.205 --> 00:58:56.325
the planets will always be within.

612
00:58:56.227 --> 00:59:06.147
this width so they will be always on this belt. We can alternatively define it for actual positions

613
00:59:06.147 --> 00:59:16.307
so depending on where the planet having the the highest latitude this is found we set the

614
00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:21.953
the edge of the zodiac in that latitude.

615
00:59:21.953 --> 00:59:46.713
the zodiac is a

616
00:59:24.073 --> 00:59:25.493
So we can also do this.

617
00:59:26.593 --> 00:59:30.593
But one thing is true, that wherever or however

618
00:59:30.593 --> 00:59:34.953
we define the zodiac in its width,

619
00:59:34.953 --> 00:59:41.573
it's for sure that the zodiac is a

620
00:59:36.274 --> 00:59:41.274
that if we look at the intersection of a belt and a horizon,

621
00:59:44.834 --> 00:59:48.954
this will belong to not only one degree,

622
00:59:48.954 --> 00:59:51.954
not only to one degree and one minute,

623
00:59:55.514 --> 00:59:56.894
or one given minute,

624
00:59:56.894 --> 00:59:59.514
but there will be a sort of an interval

625
00:59:59.784 --> 01:00:07.784
of degrees that are affected by the presence of the horizon.

626
01:00:07.784 --> 01:00:15.744
This is something I talked about, I guess it was last time, yes, when we talked about

627
01:00:15.744 --> 01:00:18.104
the fixed stars, right?

628
01:00:18.104 --> 01:00:24.264
So how the projection, zodiacal projection or the co-rising differs from each other.

629
01:00:24.528 --> 01:00:27.728
In this case, we're talking about coal rising.

630
01:00:27.728 --> 01:00:30.848
So yeah, we can say that the ascendant,

631
01:00:30.848 --> 01:00:34.248
if we just focus on a very position,

632
01:00:34.248 --> 01:00:38.888
then the ascendant itself, this is solar, right?

633
01:00:38.888 --> 01:00:41.968
But apart from that, there is nothing solar in it.

634
01:00:41.968 --> 01:00:42.808
Because,

635
01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:54.130
even if in some simplification, because a horoscopic chart is not a 3D representation of the reality,

636
01:00:54.130 --> 01:01:02.530
but a two-dimensional projection of what we see, and there are some simplifications in it.

637
01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:08.130
Yeah, even if we find, let's say, the Moon.

638
01:01:08.293 --> 01:01:20.213
or Venus or Jupiter on the ascendant, we can still say that this is where this planet rises.

639
01:01:20.213 --> 01:01:29.533
So there is no actual difference between the rising of the Sun and the rising of other

640
01:01:29.533 --> 01:01:30.653
planets.

641
01:01:30.993 --> 01:01:33.993
all planets will rise on the ascendant.

642
01:01:33.993 --> 01:01:34.993
Okay?

643
01:01:34.993 --> 01:01:41.993
What is more is a disturbing phenomenon,

644
01:01:41.993 --> 01:01:53.993
is that if you cast a chart and the sun is just a little bit below the ascendant,

645
01:01:53.993 --> 01:01:56.993
then the sun will rise.

646
01:01:54.495 --> 01:02:06.615
It doesn't mean that in reality the Sun will be under the horizon.

647
01:01:56.993 --> 01:01:57.993
Okay?

648
01:01:57.993 --> 01:01:58.993
So,

649
01:01:58.993 --> 01:01:59.993
okay.

650
01:02:06.615 --> 01:02:08.095
The causes are different.

651
01:02:08.095 --> 01:02:14.455
So there is refraction which causes refraction.

652
01:02:15.135 --> 01:02:26.295
a sun actually under the horizon to look like being above the horizon, but also the sun

653
01:02:26.295 --> 01:02:34.895
is not a point but a disk and the diameter of the disk is half a degree, so it is not

654
01:02:34.895 --> 01:02:37.615
a negligible thing.

655
01:02:37.615 --> 01:02:42.535
And also we have this twilight issue.

656
01:02:42.535 --> 01:02:43.535
Yeah.

657
01:02:43.276 --> 01:02:50.276
that the border between the night and day is not a fixed thing.

658
01:02:43.535 --> 01:02:44.535
Okay.

659
01:02:50.276 --> 01:02:57.276
And this is something that I also talked about in one talk.

660
01:02:57.276 --> 01:03:00.276
So to sum up,

661
01:03:00.968 --> 01:03:11.828
I don't think that we really have any sort of evidence to corroborate the idea that the

662
01:03:11.828 --> 01:03:20.128
ascendant should be a solar ascendant all the time and that the Lot of Fortune should

663
01:03:20.128 --> 01:03:22.488
be imagined.

664
01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:25.511
as a lunar object all the time.

665
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:30.871
Okay, but let's see the last point here.

666
01:03:33.791 --> 01:03:35.431
The Lot of Fate.

667
01:03:35.431 --> 01:03:37.011
Okay, so as I told you,

668
01:03:42.031 --> 01:03:46.511
the Lot of Fate is usually called the Lot of the Sun.

669
01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:52.489
And it is quite possible that Abraham was the author who introduced this.

670
01:03:52.489 --> 01:04:02.489
Just one more thought about this is that I have the feeling and of course this is just a feeling, right?

671
01:04:02.489 --> 01:04:07.489
So I have no hard evidence in my hand that

672
01:04:07.851 --> 01:04:26.851
In the earlier time of Hellenistic astrology, the earliest texts were written by individuals who didn't really want to reveal their own real life identity and wanted to spread their ideas.

673
01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:40.763
under the disquise of famous prophets, godly figures, kings, priests and people like that.

674
01:04:40.763 --> 01:04:47.763
And they also wanted to, how to say, to beat their

675
01:04:47.763 --> 01:04:48.763
[pause]

676
01:04:48.763 --> 01:04:56.763
[silence]

677
01:04:48.769 --> 01:04:58.689
rivals out of the market by selling their products on under more and more exotic

678
01:05:02.369 --> 01:05:10.609
surface. Let's say that. So one thing is that you can say that you can sell your product as saying that

679
01:05:11.249 --> 01:05:11.729
um

680
01:05:12.138 --> 01:05:23.138
This is original ancient prime or the Egyptian wisdom.

681
01:05:23.138 --> 01:05:35.138
But there might be people who say that, OK, Egyptian wisdom is fine for me, but there are more ancient cultures than the Egyptian culture.

682
01:05:35.138 --> 01:05:39.138
Maybe people can think in this way.

683
01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:47.410
So I guess that there were some people who also wanted to sell the product under the

684
01:05:47.410 --> 01:06:01.650
disguise of other prophets, like under the name of Zoroaster, like a Persian, a sage and a mage or whatever.

685
01:06:02.278 --> 01:06:09.278
And also who attributed their stuff to the Babylonians maybe.

686
01:06:09.278 --> 01:06:20.278
And as it seems that there were some people who wanted or at least one person who wanted to sell the product and their product under the name of Abraham.

687
01:06:20.278 --> 01:06:22.278
Yeah.

688
01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.278
Abraham the prophet.

689
01:06:24.659 --> 01:06:38.659
right? Abraham the patriarch. Yeah. So what I can imagine here is that there was the original text

690
01:06:39.779 --> 01:06:44.419
of someone who wrote on the name of Necepso.

691
01:06:44.997 --> 01:06:48.877
who introduced the idea of a lot of fortune.

692
01:06:52.157 --> 01:06:56.917
Then there were some interpretative debates

693
01:06:56.917 --> 01:07:01.917
whether this lot of fortune should be reversed by night

694
01:07:04.037 --> 01:07:08.497
or should be calculated differently

695
01:07:08.497 --> 01:07:11.057
but leading to the same results.

696
01:07:12.077 --> 01:07:12.997
And,

697
01:07:12.997 --> 01:07:13.837
and,

698
01:07:13.523 --> 01:07:24.523
The one who wrote under the name of Petosiris went with the second company.

699
01:07:24.523 --> 01:07:31.523
But then there was someone who under the name of Abraham

700
01:07:32.107 --> 01:07:37.107
tried to defend the idea that the fortune is lunar.

701
01:07:42.427 --> 01:07:47.427
But at the same time, he introduced the other lot,

702
01:07:51.027 --> 01:07:52.247
the lot of fate.

703
01:07:52.460 --> 01:08:02.620
That is like counterpart of the lot of fortune and which in some ways resolves

704
01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:11.740
this problem whether to reverse the formula by night because what if you say

705
01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:18.980
that the no reversing is acceptable then you say okay then you you can still use

706
01:08:21.434 --> 01:08:27.874
Then you can you can cast another lot and if you are your lot of fortune is lunar

707
01:08:27.874 --> 01:08:30.594
Then this lot is going to be a solar so that's very good

708
01:08:31.714 --> 01:08:37.034
But if someone says it it is only reversing that is that is fine

709
01:08:37.754 --> 01:08:42.714
And he can also say hey, this is fine, but you can still use your Diana formula

710
01:08:43.302 --> 01:08:50.782
Yeah, for the day and this is going to be a counterpart of fortune.

711
01:08:50.782 --> 01:09:05.322
And of course you can use the Nocturna formula for the day for a lot of fate.

712
01:09:05.322 --> 01:09:11.302
But actually if we take this idea that the lot of fate is solar.

713
01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:15.680
then it makes sense only if the ascendant is lunar.

714
01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.760
Because otherwise we should say that okay this is true that the

715
01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:26.880
fortune is lunar by day and fate is solar by day

716
01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.000
but by now they should be vice versa if we reverse that.

717
01:09:31.372 --> 01:09:47.532
So maybe Abraham's idea was that he wanted to join Pethoseris

718
01:09:47.532 --> 01:09:51.972
with the idea that there is no reversing.

719
01:09:51.551 --> 01:10:09.551
I mean, pathos-everase is interpretation of Necapsula, of course, but still trying to exploit the possibility of using the other formula for another lot.

720
01:10:09.551 --> 01:10:11.551
Yeah.

721
01:10:11.551 --> 01:10:18.551
And this thinking can also be imagined.

722
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:31.570
as something like, what Necapsule had in mind is that there is only one lot.

723
01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:35.770
And this is called Fortune.

724
01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:40.570
And this Fortune has no lunar or solar character.

725
01:10:41.133 --> 01:10:54.813
by definition but actually this lot has the character of the light that is not dominant

726
01:10:55.693 --> 01:11:00.333
at the moment. Let's say the out of sect or the out of faction.

727
01:11:00.578 --> 01:11:02.938
light, okay?

728
01:11:03.858 --> 01:11:05.678
Because by day,

729
01:11:07.578 --> 01:11:12.578
the calculation leads to something obviously lunar.

730
01:11:16.058 --> 01:11:19.218
And of course the moon is the out of sector,

731
01:11:19.218 --> 01:11:21.978
out of faction light by day.

732
01:11:23.678 --> 01:11:28.678
But by night, if we reverse it and it looks like

733
01:11:28.813 --> 01:11:34.573
I kept so wanted to reverse it because as I said, otherwise it wouldn't make sense to

734
01:11:34.573 --> 01:11:38.493
to to to to be so complicated.

735
01:11:40.973 --> 01:11:43.533
A lot is actually solar.

736
01:11:44.973 --> 01:11:50.413
But it is called fortune because if we have only one lot, then this lot can be.

737
01:11:51.027 --> 01:11:59.907
solar or lunar depending on whether we are talking about the diurnal or nocturnal chart.

738
01:11:59.907 --> 01:12:16.467
But from the point we split up a undifferentiated lot into a lunar lot that should be lunar

739
01:12:16.467 --> 01:12:18.427
all the time and the solar lot.

740
01:12:18.511 --> 01:12:25.511
Who will have fortune and faith in some forms?

741
01:12:25.511 --> 01:12:38.511
I say in some forms because we can imagine them in a reversed way or in an unreversed way as well.

742
01:12:38.511 --> 01:12:39.511
Yeah.

743
01:12:39.511 --> 01:12:47.511
[silence]

744
01:12:40.380 --> 01:13:03.380
So I know that this is really complicated but if you try to think about this, then you will see that the problem with understanding of the earliest strata of the lots is that at the beginning it is quite likely that there was only one lot.

745
01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:09.380
[no audio]

746
01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:16.580
And so maybe it is pointless to talk about a lunar or a solar corrector because it was a lunar and solar lot at the same time.

747
01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:21.580
And splitting up only happened later.

748
01:13:21.558 --> 01:13:29.558
Okay. Yeah, but let's see some practical considerations.

749
01:13:29.558 --> 01:13:47.558
In practical considerations, of course, I want to talk about my own practice and my own experience and then some charts that I should show you, especially famous people and celebrities.

750
01:13:48.393 --> 01:14:02.953
But what the ancient practice suggests is that we see that in the two camps there are different practices.

751
01:14:14.233 --> 01:14:15.273
So, for example,

752
01:14:16.504 --> 01:14:33.504
The ones who never reversed a lot, like Ptolemy, Petenius and Petosiris, they never allude to a lot of fate at all.

753
01:14:33.504 --> 01:14:37.504
So basically they ignore fate. They have only fortune.

754
01:14:38.029 --> 01:14:41.769
which is always a lunar knot and thank you very much.

755
01:14:43.429 --> 01:14:48.429
On the other hand, the people who also include fate

756
01:14:51.589 --> 01:14:55.269
in their ideas and this is Dorotheus,

757
01:14:56.789 --> 01:15:01.789
this is Balins, Paulus, Rhetorius and so forth.

758
01:15:03.136 --> 01:15:11.796
then they always reverse fortunate fate by night as much as we can see in the

759
01:15:11.796 --> 01:15:19.256
text okay because there are some some other authors also use also allude to

760
01:15:19.256 --> 01:15:26.056
to fate but we don't know if they if they reverse or not

761
01:15:25.172 --> 01:15:34.852
Yeah, so it has basically two consequences. At least this practice has two consequences that

762
01:15:36.692 --> 01:15:43.732
by night fortune must be solar and fate must be lunar even if we read very often that

763
01:15:43.732 --> 01:15:48.772
fortune is lunar and fate is solar. And the other consequence is

764
01:15:49.152 --> 01:15:53.592
which I also alluded to before,

765
01:15:53.592 --> 01:15:58.232
is that there is no contrast between the ascendant,

766
01:15:58.232 --> 01:16:01.032
as a solar ascendant, and a lot,

767
01:16:01.032 --> 01:16:03.072
which is the lunar ascendant,

768
01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:09.852
but between the two lots of fate and the lot of fortune.

769
01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:14.702
Yeah.

770
01:16:14.702 --> 01:16:18.022
So I guess that you are getting a little bit tired of this.

771
01:16:18.022 --> 01:16:24.822
But we will get out of this quagmire very quickly.

772
01:16:24.822 --> 01:16:31.102
What I think here is we need to keep in mind what we do,

773
01:16:31.102 --> 01:16:32.502
actually.

774
01:16:32.502 --> 01:16:33.782
OK.

775
01:16:33.782 --> 01:16:34.282
So--

776
01:16:35.469 --> 01:16:42.369
I think it is possible to go with Tanami's ideas as well as with the image

777
01:16:42.369 --> 01:16:52.989
rarity option but we should never mix up things that do not belong together.

778
01:16:54.549 --> 01:17:00.549
So in some cases we need to make a decision

779
01:16:59.849 --> 01:17:04.849
whether we are going with scenario A or scenario B,

780
01:17:05.969 --> 01:17:08.809
but we can't have both of them.

781
01:17:08.809 --> 01:17:11.429
Okay, so if there is a reversal,

782
01:17:12.529 --> 01:17:15.249
we can't claim at the same time that

783
01:17:16.569 --> 01:17:19.489
fortune is always lunar

784
01:17:19.489 --> 01:17:23.569
because it is going to be solar by night, okay?

785
01:17:23.569 --> 01:17:26.549
And it is better to keep in mind.

786
01:17:26.549 --> 01:17:27.389
So maybe,

787
01:17:27.991 --> 01:17:52.991
This whole story is a little bit exaggerated, especially if we read later sources like Masha'Allah or Abu Ma'shar, who sometimes write that by day a lot of fortune is more important, but by night a lot of fate is more important.

788
01:17:53.577 --> 01:18:02.697
which is completely understandable if we take the lots as indicators of the out,

789
01:18:02.697 --> 01:18:16.537
or indicators related to the out of sect light and representing its role in another, in a given horoscope.

790
01:18:16.537 --> 01:18:17.037
Okay.

791
01:18:17.398 --> 01:18:26.058
But apart from all this, what is generally true for the two lots of fate and fortune

792
01:18:26.058 --> 01:18:32.418
is that they are also lunar phase indicators.

793
01:18:32.418 --> 01:18:41.898
Because by mapping the interval between the two lights and projecting it from the ascendant,

794
01:18:41.954 --> 01:18:52.954
We can actually see how the lunar phase manifests itself in the horoscope.

795
01:18:52.954 --> 01:19:03.954
To be absolutely concrete in this case, if you look at this chart, which is a night chart,

796
01:19:03.954 --> 01:19:10.954
and you see that the Sun is under the horizon and here we can see the Moon,

797
01:19:11.725 --> 01:19:16.725
This angle implies that we are in the last quarter.

798
01:19:17.725 --> 01:19:19.125
This is actual now.

799
01:19:20.865 --> 01:19:25.765
If it is the last quarter and it is the night,

800
01:19:27.265 --> 01:19:32.265
then the lot of fortune will be the last quarter.

801
01:19:33.697 --> 01:19:49.557
90 degrees or fewer from the ascendant and the same is true for the Lot of Fate but in

802
01:19:49.557 --> 01:19:54.497
the way that the Lot of Fortune is going to be under the horizon and the Lot of Fate is

803
01:19:54.497 --> 01:19:56.217
going to be above the horizon.

804
01:19:56.574 --> 01:20:09.854
yeah so basically during a lunar month both lots so to speak will have a full round around

805
01:20:10.414 --> 01:20:18.254
the zodiac yeah but this brings us to a digression

806
01:20:18.812 --> 01:20:26.012
that I would like to make about the motions and the prestigions of the lots.

807
01:20:26.012 --> 01:20:31.692
Okay, because sometimes this can give us some headache, right?

808
01:20:31.692 --> 01:20:36.812
So, one thing is that I just mentioned that

809
01:20:36.812 --> 01:20:46.812
[pause]

810
01:20:38.775 --> 01:20:48.335
Both fortunate fates are lunar phase indicators and in a lunar month they make a full round

811
01:20:48.335 --> 01:20:54.215
full turn in the zodiac.

812
01:20:54.215 --> 01:20:55.215
But actually

813
01:20:55.215 --> 01:20:56.295
[pause]

814
01:20:56.853 --> 01:21:08.653
If we reverse them by night, then this is not exactly true, because in the switch of

815
01:21:08.653 --> 01:21:15.133
day and night, they will exchange place with each other and they will continue their course.

816
01:21:15.133 --> 01:21:17.853
But more importantly,

817
01:21:17.853 --> 01:21:25.853
[inaudible]

818
01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:18.874
They don't move.

819
01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:21.874
They don't actually move.

820
01:21:21.874 --> 01:21:27.714
So this is just an artifact that we see here.

821
01:21:27.714 --> 01:21:31.714
This movement we see here.

822
01:21:31.714 --> 01:21:36.714
LODs don't move at all because LODs are indicators,

823
01:21:36.714 --> 01:21:37.874
in the best case.

824
01:21:38.589 --> 01:21:47.589
So they fall somewhere in a given horoscope and they fall someplace else in another horoscope.

825
01:21:47.589 --> 01:21:53.589
And of course we can discover some rules, but actually they don't move.

826
01:21:53.589 --> 01:21:57.589
So that's why we should not...

827
01:21:57.959 --> 01:22:10.959
make a fuss about the anomalous movement of some different lots, lots of fortune and faith,

828
01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:14.959
because they don't make any motion at all.

829
01:22:18.959 --> 01:22:20.959
So this is one thing.

830
01:22:21.126 --> 01:22:35.886
The other thing is that I mentioned that some lots were cast only by sign and for example

831
01:22:35.886 --> 01:22:46.046
violins also does something really interesting that I mentioned in my first Holroyd talk

832
01:22:46.046 --> 01:22:47.046
that's

833
01:22:47.046 --> 01:22:51.046
I'm sorry.

834
01:22:47.498 --> 01:22:57.498
He calculates the Lot of Fortune by sign and by degree, too.

835
01:22:57.498 --> 01:23:10.498
And in one part of his anthologies he uses, he goes with the sign-wise Lot of Fortune and the other case with the degree-wise Lot of Fortune.

836
01:23:10.498 --> 01:23:11.498
And...

837
01:23:11.629 --> 01:23:21.629
it happens that as it can happen that they these two versions of the same lot fall into different signs and

838
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:29.629
in some cases he goes with one and in some cases he goes with the other one and it doesn't seem to be a problem for him.

839
01:23:30.734 --> 01:23:44.474
But it also brings us to the question that, okay, but is it all of this that we have lots

840
01:23:44.474 --> 01:23:48.294
by sign and we have lots by degree and that's all?

841
01:23:48.294 --> 01:23:50.534
Or we can move on a little bit.

842
01:23:50.534 --> 01:23:53.094
And it looks like that in the...

843
01:23:53.094 --> 01:24:00.094
In the...

844
01:23:54.371 --> 01:24:07.051
Let's say early modern European astrology, especially toward its end in the 17th century,

845
01:24:07.051 --> 01:24:20.211
there were some attempts to interpret Ptolemy and to try to grasp his idea of

846
01:24:21.256 --> 01:24:36.176
of the fortune as the lunar ascendant a little bit further and to develop an even more precise

847
01:24:36.176 --> 01:24:39.256
version of the lot of fortune.

848
01:24:39.256 --> 01:24:42.736
Okay, I should be clearer, I guess.

849
01:24:42.736 --> 01:24:44.936
So what they thought is that.

850
01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:59.570
Ptolemy says that the proportion that the Sun has with the ascendant should be the same

851
01:24:59.570 --> 01:25:04.770
as the proportion that the Moon has to the lot of fortune.

852
01:25:04.770 --> 01:25:07.330
But how do we interpret this proportion issue?

853
01:25:07.693 --> 01:25:08.693
Yeah.

854
01:25:08.693 --> 01:25:20.853
Now, if we start thinking about this, this will basically lead to the same issues and

855
01:25:20.853 --> 01:25:25.973
problems people have with the so-called house systems.

856
01:25:25.973 --> 01:25:33.173
So that's how a three-dimensional reality could be projected into a two-dimensional

857
01:25:33.173 --> 01:25:34.173
horoscope.

858
01:25:34.173 --> 01:25:35.173
Yeah.

859
01:25:34.486 --> 01:25:52.246
Yeah. And the famous Italian polymath, Placido, who you know by the name of Placidus, who

860
01:25:35.173 --> 01:25:36.173
Okay.

861
01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:37.173
So, yeah.

862
01:25:52.246 --> 01:25:59.606
gave his name for a very popular modern, and not so modern actually, house system, had

863
01:25:59.606 --> 01:26:02.606
an idea.

864
01:26:00.744 --> 01:26:10.744
But his idea was also revised and elaborated by some more Italian people.

865
01:26:13.744 --> 01:26:28.744
And basically they arrived at a kind of placid style division system that finds a lot of fortune some places.

866
01:26:28.821 --> 01:26:36.981
Yeah, but I just wanted to mention this because I don't really think that these ideas are

867
01:26:36.981 --> 01:26:40.981
really well known in English speaking countries.

868
01:26:40.981 --> 01:26:47.341
So basically, these were Italians and they wrote in Latin.

869
01:26:47.341 --> 01:26:53.061
So the ideas were not in widespread circulation everywhere.

870
01:26:53.521 --> 01:27:03.521
But of course this is something that practitioners,

871
01:27:03.521 --> 01:27:07.521
practicing astrologers should ask themselves with question,

872
01:27:07.521 --> 01:27:15.521
whether they are happy with degree-based a lot of fortunate lots in general,

873
01:27:15.521 --> 01:27:21.521
or they say that even simpler version of sign-based

874
01:27:22.893 --> 01:27:29.893
Lots are enough, which were quite enough in many ancient horoscopes,

875
01:27:29.893 --> 01:27:32.893
and the majority of ancient horoscopes actually,

876
01:27:32.893 --> 01:27:41.893
or they would also like to go further and to come up with some more sophisticated

877
01:27:41.893 --> 01:27:49.893
and mathematically and cosmologically more sound solutions.

878
01:27:50.195 --> 01:27:56.755
Okay, but the point also here is I would like to repeat that lots don't move.

879
01:27:56.755 --> 01:28:00.515
Okay, even if they look like moving, they don't move.

880
01:28:00.515 --> 01:28:02.315
These are indicators.

881
01:28:02.315 --> 01:28:09.075
So let me summarize what I said about a fortunate fate.

882
01:28:09.474 --> 01:28:22.354
And then we can move on and it is good because we are over the half of my expose now.

883
01:28:22.354 --> 01:28:31.714
So what my point was that at the beginning or originally,

884
01:28:31.714 --> 01:28:34.754
we had a lot of problems.

885
01:28:31.994 --> 01:28:45.514
It is very likely that fortune was a lunar phase indicator in some ways or and a lunar

886
01:28:34.754 --> 01:28:38.754
We had a lot of problems.

887
01:28:45.514 --> 01:28:50.634
or solar counterpart of the ascendant for Nec Hapso.

888
01:28:50.634 --> 01:28:58.674
I don't think that for Nec Hapso a lot of fortune which I think he wanted to reverse

889
01:28:58.674 --> 01:28:59.674
by night.

890
01:28:59.674 --> 01:29:01.674
I don't think that.

891
01:28:59.887 --> 01:29:15.007
was always lunar. With fate added, fortune was formulated as a lunar lot and fate is a solar lot

892
01:29:15.007 --> 01:29:22.527
but strictly speaking this is valid only for the day because if we reverse the formula for the night

893
01:29:22.527 --> 01:29:27.167
then fortune will become solar and fate will become lunar.

894
01:29:27.788 --> 01:29:41.028
by the night. Apart from this, we can study the use of a lot of fortunate fate in many

895
01:29:41.028 --> 01:29:48.308
horoscopes. We can see how they were used for thought reading,

896
01:29:48.308 --> 01:29:49.308
and

897
01:29:48.314 --> 01:29:53.314
how they were used in length of life calculations,

898
01:29:49.308 --> 01:29:50.308
how they were used for

899
01:29:50.308 --> 01:29:51.308
thought reading,

900
01:29:51.308 --> 01:29:52.308
and

901
01:29:52.308 --> 01:29:53.308
how they were used for

902
01:29:53.308 --> 01:29:54.308
thought reading,

903
01:29:53.794 --> 01:29:57.434
in the so-called zodiacal releasing.

904
01:29:54.308 --> 01:29:55.308
and

905
01:29:55.308 --> 01:29:56.308
how they were used for

906
01:29:56.308 --> 01:29:57.308
thought reading,

907
01:29:57.434 --> 01:30:01.034
But of course, in many original horoscopes

908
01:30:01.034 --> 01:30:04.314
don't have any interpretations, only raw data.

909
01:30:02.514 --> 01:30:17.514
But one thing is clear that fortune is not a

910
01:30:11.208 --> 01:30:21.888
at least fortune was used by virtually all the astrologers. Okay, now let's see how the

911
01:30:21.888 --> 01:30:32.688
idea of firstly a lot of fortune and then the idea of the two lots were further refined.

912
01:30:32.688 --> 01:30:34.408
Already in the first century,

913
01:30:34.784 --> 01:30:45.784
Dorotheus makes allusions to two further lots which I will call desire and constraint.

914
01:30:45.784 --> 01:30:52.784
Okay, so desire is the lot that is called also the lot of love or lot of arrows.

915
01:30:53.044 --> 01:31:03.044
and constraint is the lot of necessity or it is called "ananke" in Greek.

916
01:31:03.044 --> 01:31:09.044
I chose this translation "desire" and "constraint"

917
01:31:09.044 --> 01:31:14.044
because of course that could be

918
01:31:14.044 --> 01:31:22.044
[inaudible]

919
01:31:16.223 --> 01:31:27.903
translations as well. But because I wanted to highlight that in this case we have

920
01:31:30.623 --> 01:31:43.263
strongly philosophical concepts behind these two additional lots. And also that they refer to

921
01:31:44.143 --> 01:31:49.143
to something that can be contrasted.

922
01:31:50.143 --> 01:31:54.343
So desire in this case means attraction

923
01:31:54.343 --> 01:31:56.623
to something or someone.

924
01:31:57.863 --> 01:32:02.863
So it means that even if there is a drive

925
01:32:04.303 --> 01:32:09.303
that comes from inside or if it's an outward attraction,

926
01:32:10.423 --> 01:32:13.423
it's not a direct attraction.

927
01:32:10.927 --> 01:32:15.927
the individual is moving towards something.

928
01:32:18.927 --> 01:32:23.927
Whereas constraint means right the opposite.

929
01:32:24.007 --> 01:32:29.007
It means the inability to move towards something

930
01:32:29.407 --> 01:32:34.407
or if it is possible, it means moving backwards

931
01:32:36.007 --> 01:32:39.007
or inwards in some ways.

932
01:32:39.976 --> 01:32:45.976
And of course it can be something that comes from inside as well.

933
01:32:45.976 --> 01:32:57.976
So that's, let's say, it's a conscious decision maybe, or even non-conscious,

934
01:32:57.976 --> 01:33:06.976
self-imposed constraint, but it can be also an outward constraint,

935
01:33:06.976 --> 01:33:08.976
like something pushing back.

936
01:33:09.661 --> 01:33:20.341
Now, I mentioned that these are found in Dorotheus, but you might say that, oh, this is surprising

937
01:33:20.341 --> 01:33:27.501
because I have read Dorotheus's Arabic version and I haven't found any reference to desire

938
01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:30.501
and constraint in Ander-Eli names.

939
01:33:30.501 --> 01:33:35.421
This is not a coincidence because, as you might know,

940
01:33:35.568 --> 01:33:45.168
there are some sections that are missing from the Arabic Dorotheus that were demonstrably

941
01:33:45.168 --> 01:33:50.808
there in the Greek original.

942
01:33:50.808 --> 01:33:51.808
These sections

943
01:33:51.808 --> 01:33:52.808
are

944
01:33:52.808 --> 01:33:53.808
not

945
01:33:53.172 --> 01:34:02.772
covered the treatment of activity or action which is completely absent from the Arabic version

946
01:33:53.808 --> 01:33:54.808
there.

947
01:33:54.808 --> 01:34:04.808
They are not there.

948
01:34:04.612 --> 01:34:13.732
but most notably they cover the question of friendship and enmity and in this case

949
01:34:14.327 --> 01:34:25.727
It looks like Dorotheus used as much as we can reconstruct it from some stray Greek fragments.

950
01:34:25.727 --> 01:34:33.727
Dorotheus used these lots in the context of analyzing friendship and enmity.

951
01:34:33.927 --> 01:34:44.207
Unfortunately, we don't have extensive fragments to see what he meant.

952
01:34:44.207 --> 01:34:52.967
All we have, or the most extensive we have is the so-called Book of Aristotle that relied

953
01:34:52.967 --> 01:34:59.367
on Dorotheus in some ways, and which looks like to be a...

954
01:34:59.367 --> 01:34:59.527
[pause]

955
01:34:59.928 --> 01:35:10.288
and Latin translation of something written by Alandar Zagar in the 7th century or so,

956
01:35:10.288 --> 01:35:13.928
a Persian astrologer.

957
01:35:13.928 --> 01:35:25.968
But it is quite likely that the Lot of Desire was designed to show indications for friendship

958
01:35:25.968 --> 01:35:29.288
and constraint for enmity.

959
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:33.109
Now, what are they? The big question.

960
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:37.109
Desire is

961
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:41.109
from fortune to fate

962
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:57.109
and constraint inversely

963
01:35:51.271 --> 01:35:56.271
Yeah, and both are reversed by night.

964
01:35:56.271 --> 01:36:05.351
Okay, so both are reversed by night and for the night we would have this interval and

965
01:36:05.351 --> 01:36:09.111
we will project it from the ascendant.

966
01:36:09.111 --> 01:36:12.311
So we will find some place here.

967
01:36:12.311 --> 01:36:16.711
So here we will find desire.

968
01:36:16.711 --> 01:36:19.831
And we will have.

969
01:36:18.646 --> 01:36:27.766
constraint here. Yeah. So we can, we can do something like we measure this distance and

970
01:36:19.831 --> 01:36:20.831
Okay.

971
01:36:27.766 --> 01:36:34.246
we cause distance from here, uh, from, from the ascendant and we can, we can get here.

972
01:36:34.246 --> 01:36:39.486
So we will have constraint here. Yeah.

973
01:36:40.026 --> 01:36:59.026
What you see is that the midpoint between the Ascendant and Desire is Fortune and the midpoint between the Ascendant and Constraint is Fortune.

974
01:36:59.129 --> 01:37:00.769
Fate

975
01:37:00.769 --> 01:37:01.909
Yeah

976
01:37:01.909 --> 01:37:03.909
Okay, so this is not a coincidence

977
01:37:04.649 --> 01:37:09.249
Because this follows from the calculation from the formula itself

978
01:37:10.449 --> 01:37:12.449
in the reality

979
01:37:12.769 --> 01:37:14.649
by day

980
01:37:14.649 --> 01:37:17.569
desire is a sort of a double fate and

981
01:37:19.089 --> 01:37:21.089
and

982
01:37:21.729 --> 01:37:23.729
Double fortune

983
01:37:23.108 --> 01:37:29.748
by night. Here we see that it is a double fortune and this follows from the calculation.

984
01:37:30.548 --> 01:37:40.228
Now constraint works inversely. So it is a double fortune by day and a double fate by night.

985
01:37:42.068 --> 01:37:47.348
And if we look at their motion which is a virtual motion as I said so they don't really

986
01:37:49.854 --> 01:38:02.034
appears real motion. Then by the double reversing, and by double reversing I mean that their

987
01:38:02.034 --> 01:38:13.294
constituent parts, that is fortune and fate, are reversed by night, and then the lots themselves,

988
01:38:13.294 --> 01:38:14.494
desire and constraint.

989
01:38:14.836 --> 01:38:17.916
are reversed by night again.

990
01:38:21.316 --> 01:38:24.036
They do not switch by night.

991
01:38:25.996 --> 01:38:30.996
So they have a double speed motion,

992
01:38:34.636 --> 01:38:39.636
a virtual motion as compared to the lots of fortunate fate.

993
01:38:44.255 --> 01:38:47.315
Which means that within a lunar month,

994
01:38:48.735 --> 01:38:52.855
they will have two complete circles.

995
01:38:55.615 --> 01:39:00.015
So they will be at the new moon,

996
01:39:00.015 --> 01:39:02.195
they will be at the ascendant.

997
01:39:02.497 --> 01:39:15.197
But they will be at the Ascendant again at Full Moon, unlike Fortunate Fate which are

998
01:39:15.197 --> 01:39:19.037
on the Descendant at Full Moon.

999
01:39:19.037 --> 01:39:26.937
Now there are a few horoscopes surviving from antiquity that used the

1000
01:39:27.555 --> 01:39:32.555
a lot of desire and constraint.

1001
01:39:29.937 --> 01:39:31.937
Horoscope

1002
01:39:34.315 --> 01:39:39.315
And these are found in Dorian Greenbaum's book

1003
01:39:40.115 --> 01:39:42.715
in Appendix 10c.

1004
01:39:44.035 --> 01:39:49.035
But actually from these proscos we don't really learn

1005
01:39:49.075 --> 01:39:52.955
too much about the use of these slots because

1006
01:39:53.259 --> 01:40:03.259
the majority of these handful of horoscopes only give us the positions but not the interpretations.

1007
01:40:04.139 --> 01:40:12.699
So the only horoscope from antiquity that have an interpretation utilizes only desire and this is

1008
01:40:12.699 --> 01:40:20.219
the horoscope of Constantine VII, the Byzantine Empire, emperor.

1009
01:40:21.602 --> 01:40:26.202
And here it is analyzed for friendship,

1010
01:40:26.202 --> 01:40:29.282
but it is a very brief passage

1011
01:40:29.282 --> 01:40:31.122
that you can read in my translation.

1012
01:40:32.642 --> 01:40:37.642
But there is an interesting use of the lot of desire

1013
01:40:40.122 --> 01:40:44.782
or constraint, which is described by violence.

1014
01:40:44.932 --> 01:40:53.892
Valence says that there is a lot of foundation and this lot of foundation is identical to

1015
01:40:53.892 --> 01:41:01.972
either desire or constraint depending on which of them is found under the horizon.

1016
01:41:02.959 --> 01:41:07.959
So if it is desired, then desire is going to be under the lot of foundation.

1017
01:41:07.959 --> 01:41:10.959
And if it is constrained, then it is constrained.

1018
01:41:10.959 --> 01:41:16.959
Here in this horoscope, you will see that this is desire that is found under the horizon.

1019
01:41:16.959 --> 01:41:31.959
So if we go with violence, then we should choose desire as the lot of foundation.

1020
01:41:29.035 --> 01:41:47.035
which Valens uses in a handful of horoscopes to show eminence and success in life.

1021
01:41:47.035 --> 01:41:53.035
Now the interesting thing is that Firmicus also has

1022
01:41:53.035 --> 01:41:58.035
a

1023
01:41:53.504 --> 01:42:05.344
reference to a lot of foundation. But his formula is identical to the formula of desire,

1024
01:42:05.344 --> 01:42:11.224
which is otherwise problematic as well because of...

1025
01:42:11.224 --> 01:42:12.504
Vermicose is...

1026
01:42:13.025 --> 01:42:24.585
is a source that describes the formula of constraint or desire and the formula of desire

1027
01:42:24.585 --> 01:42:32.705
for constraints. So basically he exchanges the two formulas.

1028
01:42:32.705 --> 01:42:38.345
Now it is quite possible that Firmicus's information here is corrupt because this is a section

1029
01:42:42.984 --> 01:42:47.984
even if it is original, it looks like there was a sort of,

1030
01:42:50.584 --> 01:42:53.984
this idea was not violence is owned,

1031
01:42:53.984 --> 01:42:58.984
but somehow either desire and constraint or constraint

1032
01:43:02.704 --> 01:43:07.704
or desire itself was also conceptualized.

1033
01:43:08.517 --> 01:43:16.997
as a lot of foundation, which as the name suggests, something really important for the nativity.

1034
01:43:19.557 --> 01:43:26.517
Now we could speculate about this and I guess that there have already been some speculations

1035
01:43:26.517 --> 01:43:34.437
whether this should be something meaningful for the natives, whether there are a lot of foundation

1036
01:43:37.710 --> 01:43:42.710
positive or to constraint, which is something unwanted.

1037
01:43:44.630 --> 01:43:49.630
But the fact that these lots are still

1038
01:43:52.150 --> 01:43:57.150
lunar phase indicators imply that there will be

1039
01:43:58.770 --> 01:44:03.770
a certain rule that is not true.

1040
01:44:03.703 --> 01:44:08.703
in whether desire or constraint is the lot of foundation.

1041
01:44:12.903 --> 01:44:14.943
And this rule is very simple.

1042
01:44:14.943 --> 01:44:18.223
In the first and the third quarter of the month,

1043
01:44:18.223 --> 01:44:20.743
constraint will be foundation,

1044
01:44:20.743 --> 01:44:25.663
but in the second and fourth quarter, desire.

1045
01:44:25.868 --> 01:44:30.868
Okay, now we see that this is the fourth quarter of the month.

1046
01:44:30.868 --> 01:44:36.868
No surprise, desire is under the horizon and desire

1047
01:44:36.868 --> 01:44:42.868
is going to be the lot of foundation.

1048
01:44:42.868 --> 01:44:50.868
Okay, but apart from this thing,

1049
01:44:50.868 --> 01:44:52.868
uh,

1050
01:44:52.672 --> 01:45:04.492
We could also ask ourselves the question that how the set of two lots, a lot of fortune

1051
01:45:04.492 --> 01:45:13.552
and a lot of fate is extended to a set of four lots.

1052
01:45:13.938 --> 01:45:22.778
Okay, but for this, let me go back to the meaning of a lot of fortune and to let me

1053
01:45:22.778 --> 01:45:31.358
clear my debt of not having spoken about the lot of faith, its meaning actually.

1054
01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:36.978
But at least it will give me the primary opportunity to show you how

1055
01:45:36.978 --> 01:45:42.978
the

1056
01:45:37.803 --> 01:45:49.803
This thinking goes to the inclusion of desire and constraint as well.

1057
01:45:49.803 --> 01:45:55.803
Okay, so we started with fortune actually.

1058
01:45:55.803 --> 01:45:57.803
And I told you that

1059
01:45:58.342 --> 01:46:12.022
Fortune as an indicator was used to give some indications about the body, about health,

1060
01:46:12.022 --> 01:46:16.742
about life in general, and also about success.

1061
01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:29.320
So we could say that if there is a sort of just one single lot, and we call it the lot of fortune,

1062
01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:37.320
then this lot of fortune is an indicator of well-being in general.

1063
01:46:37.645 --> 01:46:47.405
yeah but the the name uh if it is contrasted with fate

1064
01:46:50.045 --> 01:46:54.925
will specifically mean something that happens

1065
01:46:55.778 --> 01:47:00.778
without our choice in the outer world, right?

1066
01:47:02.538 --> 01:47:05.978
So as we also speak about luck,

1067
01:47:05.978 --> 01:47:08.678
and when we talk about luck,

1068
01:47:08.678 --> 01:47:13.678
we always mean something that is not under our own control,

1069
01:47:14.578 --> 01:47:16.538
that just happens to us, yeah?

1070
01:47:17.438 --> 01:47:19.838
Of course, we could say that everything that is found

1071
01:47:19.838 --> 01:47:24.358
in the horoscope should show something that happens

1072
01:47:27.192 --> 01:47:30.072
Yeah, but in the case of fortune,

1073
01:47:30.072 --> 01:47:32.172
this is especially emphasized.

1074
01:47:33.812 --> 01:47:38.812
Now this whole idea related to fortune and fate

1075
01:47:40.432 --> 01:47:45.432
seemed to be originally Egyptian,

1076
01:47:46.612 --> 01:47:51.612
but Egyptian and Greek thinking met with each other.

1077
01:47:53.333 --> 01:48:09.333
And somehow the Greek concept of immutable fate met with the Egyptian and Oriental idea of negotiable fate.

1078
01:48:09.333 --> 01:48:12.333
And this is how...

1079
01:48:13.107 --> 01:48:19.107
astrology with its own jainist faces was developed.

1080
01:48:19.107 --> 01:48:27.107
Because on one hand, astrologers tend to emphasize that the fate,

1081
01:48:27.107 --> 01:48:36.107
the destiny in general, indicated by a birth chart is immutable.

1082
01:48:36.107 --> 01:48:42.107
[no audio]

1083
01:48:36.492 --> 01:48:40.492
So nobody can transcend their their nativity.

1084
01:48:40.492 --> 01:48:51.492
But on the other hand, the very existence of inceptions and magical practices suggests that somehow fate is still negotiable.

1085
01:48:53.492 --> 01:48:58.492
Now, as it looks, the lot of fate.

1086
01:48:59.390 --> 01:49:13.590
was a sort of a counterpart in the way that it was in some ways similar to the indication

1087
01:49:13.590 --> 01:49:18.190
of faith by saying that whereas...

1088
01:49:18.825 --> 01:49:23.825
Fortune is about material wealth,

1089
01:49:24.825 --> 01:49:29.825
faith is about spiritual wealth,

1090
01:49:29.825 --> 01:49:40.825
and whereas fortune is material success,

1091
01:49:41.211 --> 01:49:50.331
Fate is more like spiritual development or character development.

1092
01:49:50.331 --> 01:50:02.571
If you look at some texts, you see that character in general, if it was investigated at all,

1093
01:50:02.571 --> 01:50:08.611
was mostly investigated through fate.

1094
01:50:05.778 --> 01:50:15.878
The lot of faith because in this case faith was something was imagined something that is is a sort of.

1095
01:50:16.378 --> 01:50:19.158
Diety living in the individual.

1096
01:50:20.358 --> 01:50:24.638
That in some some some ways.

1097
01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:28.620
guides this individual.

1098
01:50:25.498 --> 01:50:26.398
I'm.

1099
01:50:27.298 --> 01:50:28.298
I'm.

1100
01:50:29.598 --> 01:50:30.598
I'm.

1101
01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:35.020
And its guidance can be accepted or can be denied.

1102
01:50:32.098 --> 01:50:33.098
I'm.

1103
01:50:34.098 --> 01:50:35.098
I'm.

1104
01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:43.700
So in some ways, fortunate fate represents something

1105
01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:50.140
out of the individual, the sort of random

1106
01:50:51.646 --> 01:50:56.646
events of the outer world, that is fortune,

1107
01:50:57.886 --> 01:51:02.286
and the inner reality of the individual,

1108
01:51:02.286 --> 01:51:07.286
which is indicated by fate.

1109
01:51:10.786 --> 01:51:14.326
Of course, this is too complex because

1110
01:51:19.034 --> 01:51:21.474
I don't think that there was a single understanding

1111
01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:24.834
of these concepts necessarily.

1112
01:51:25.674 --> 01:51:30.674
As I said, we see, and if you read Greenbaum's book

1113
01:51:31.594 --> 01:51:35.154
about the diamond, then you will see that how many

1114
01:51:35.154 --> 01:51:38.154
different concepts are there.

1115
01:51:36.612 --> 01:51:44.852
ideas of different cultures were amalgamated in these concepts.

1116
01:51:38.154 --> 01:51:40.154
And if you look at the diamond,

1117
01:51:40.154 --> 01:51:43.154
you will see that there are many different concepts

1118
01:51:43.154 --> 01:51:43.994
that are there.

1119
01:51:44.852 --> 01:51:56.332
And I think it is not just a philosophical question in this case, but also a very, very important interpretative question in this astrology as well.

1120
01:51:57.259 --> 01:52:02.259
that different authors and different astrologers

1121
01:52:03.779 --> 01:52:08.779
grasped meanings of these lots differently,

1122
01:52:09.819 --> 01:52:13.079
but these were in general applicable.

1123
01:52:14.779 --> 01:52:19.779
Now, how can we include the existence of desire

1124
01:52:23.819 --> 01:52:27.239
and constraint into this frame?

1125
01:52:27.186 --> 01:52:55.186
I think the answer is very simple that desire, which is like an inner drive, seems to be an extension of fate, which is, which is this, say the the basic level of desire, basic level, which is the, which is like a voice that that sounds inside your head.

1126
01:52:55.955 --> 01:53:00.955
But unless you give your approval to this voice,

1127
01:53:08.075 --> 01:53:13.075
no real desire emerges that would push you towards something.

1128
01:53:21.955 --> 01:53:22.915
Similarly,

1129
01:53:24.279 --> 01:53:37.919
constraint looks like an extension of fortune because fortune is basically an umbrella term

1130
01:53:37.919 --> 01:53:43.839
to anything that happens in the outer world that can be positive or negative but it's

1131
01:53:43.839 --> 01:53:48.679
about the outer world and these are things that we don't have control on.

1132
01:53:49.083 --> 01:54:09.323
But constraint is something that emphasizes the effect of these things on the individual.

1133
01:54:09.323 --> 01:54:15.003
On the other hand, and I didn't write it here, we can also argue that

1134
01:54:15.773 --> 01:54:27.573
That constraint and desire can come from the other source as well.

1135
01:54:27.573 --> 01:54:35.573
What I mean is that desire can be an outward attractor as well.

1136
01:54:35.986 --> 01:54:46.986
or constraint can be a consciously chosen decision as well.

1137
01:54:46.986 --> 01:54:55.986
And in this way, we could also see the connection of desire to fortune, actually.

1138
01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:59.556
and constraint to fate.

1139
01:54:59.556 --> 01:55:02.396
And it would make sense in some ways

1140
01:55:02.396 --> 01:55:07.396
because if we remain with the reversed lot of fortune

1141
01:55:11.436 --> 01:55:16.436
and fate and we cast desire and constraint

1142
01:55:18.136 --> 01:55:20.236
in the way they are given,

1143
01:55:20.516 --> 01:55:31.796
then it happens by night actually that technically desire will be an extension of fortune like

1144
01:55:31.796 --> 01:55:46.276
in this very chart and not the not of fate as we would expect if we went with the conceptualization

1145
01:55:46.276 --> 01:55:49.276
I mentioned first.

1146
01:55:47.906 --> 01:55:59.646
Okay, so that's all I just wanted to say about these four lots, including the lot of foundation.

1147
01:55:59.646 --> 01:56:10.786
I don't actually know what sort of meanings lot of foundation had besides

1148
01:56:10.786 --> 01:56:12.506
the foundation.

1149
01:56:12.832 --> 01:56:25.992
showing, so being another yet another indicator of success and wealth and well-being, whether

1150
01:56:25.992 --> 01:56:33.432
these philosophical ideas were implemented in any ways in actual horoscopic work, but

1151
01:56:33.432 --> 01:56:39.472
at least these are some, these are things that are worthy of consideration.

1152
01:56:39.472 --> 01:56:40.472
Okay.

1153
01:56:39.896 --> 01:56:40.896
Yeah.

1154
01:56:40.472 --> 01:56:42.472
Thank you.

1155
01:56:40.896 --> 01:56:53.436
But now let me move on to the system that looks like further development of the four

1156
01:56:53.436 --> 01:56:54.936
lot system.

1157
01:56:54.936 --> 01:56:58.376
And this is the seven lots of Hermes.

1158
01:56:58.376 --> 01:56:58.896
Just a moment.

1159
01:57:01.519 --> 01:57:11.519
This is something that is I guess it's especially popular in secondary astrological literature.

1160
01:57:11.519 --> 01:57:17.519
The so-called seven lots of Hermes or the seven Hermetic lots.

1161
01:57:17.519 --> 01:57:22.519
But actually there is only one source that describes them.

1162
01:57:22.958 --> 01:57:30.158
or more precisely for a long time there was only one source that described them

1163
01:57:30.158 --> 01:57:39.758
and this is Paulus in his chapter 21 according to my own numbering where he refers to a work

1164
01:57:41.198 --> 01:57:42.798
titled "All Virtues"

1165
01:57:43.499 --> 01:57:48.499
where these seven hermetic lots are described.

1166
01:57:50.659 --> 01:57:54.499
They are called hermetic lots because Olin Peodorus,

1167
01:57:54.499 --> 01:57:59.499
who comments on Paulus' introduction,

1168
01:58:03.099 --> 01:58:06.339
says explicitly that this all-virtues,

1169
01:58:06.339 --> 01:58:10.519
this last work was authored by Hermes Trismegistus.

1170
01:58:10.432 --> 01:58:18.832
Now, apart from this piece of information, we don't know about the authorship, but of

1171
01:58:18.832 --> 01:58:26.992
course this authorship means nothing because it could have been authored by anyone using

1172
01:58:26.992 --> 01:58:36.192
the pen name of Hermes if it is true, at least if Olympeo Doris's information is valid.

1173
01:58:37.412 --> 01:58:51.652
But at least one thing is quite solid, that this all-virtues was not Polus' own figment,

1174
01:58:52.612 --> 01:59:00.612
because these lots already appear in a horoscope found in a papyrus horoscope,

1175
01:59:00.612 --> 01:59:02.692
that was found in Egypt somewhere.

1176
01:59:04.084 --> 01:59:19.924
and which is dated to 318 so for someone who was born that year no 18 it's 19 sorry it's 319

1177
01:59:19.924 --> 01:59:28.244
so it's sorry for for for the typo yeah which suggests that that um

1178
01:59:28.958 --> 01:59:34.958
sometime in the third century, yes, in the fourth century, these lots were already in use.

1179
01:59:34.958 --> 01:59:49.958
Okay, but I would like to show you that the system of seven lots is obviously a reinterpretation of the four-lot system.

1180
01:59:50.254 --> 01:59:53.614
So it must be later than the four lot system.

1181
01:59:55.054 --> 02:00:00.054
And if you ask for my opinion,

1182
02:00:00.574 --> 02:00:04.534
I think it is inferior to the four lot system

1183
02:00:04.534 --> 02:00:08.014
for the reasons I will tell you very quickly.

1184
02:00:10.383 --> 02:00:20.383
So it is not very original and I don't really think that it was developed long before the 4th century

1185
02:00:20.383 --> 02:00:25.383
even if I don't have any evidence or counter evidence for this claim.

1186
02:00:25.383 --> 02:00:29.383
Okay, but let's see what it consists of.

1187
02:00:29.383 --> 02:00:30.383
Okay.

1188
02:00:30.383 --> 02:00:39.383
[Pause]

1189
02:00:30.726 --> 02:00:39.486
Sorry, I didn't mean this lecture series as a basic introduction to astrology.

1190
02:00:39.486 --> 02:00:46.486
So I expect some, I often expect you to be familiar with things like lots and things

1191
02:00:46.486 --> 02:00:47.486
like that.

1192
02:00:47.486 --> 02:00:50.246
And I also expect you to be some sort of

1193
02:00:50.541 --> 02:00:55.541
sort of familiar with the seven Hermetic lots,

1194
02:00:56.221 --> 02:00:58.401
the seven lots of Hermes.

1195
02:00:58.401 --> 02:01:02.961
Okay, but I would like to focus on the important features.

1196
02:01:02.961 --> 02:01:03.801
Right?

1197
02:01:06.441 --> 02:01:09.061
In this system, there are seven lots

1198
02:01:09.061 --> 02:01:11.121
and each lots are code,

1199
02:01:13.013 --> 02:01:19.253
a lot of sun, a lot of the moon, a lot of Mercury, a lot of Venus and so forth

1200
02:01:21.093 --> 02:01:30.693
covering all the seven planets. No surprise, a lot of fortune is a reversed lot and it is

1201
02:01:31.493 --> 02:01:33.973
associated with the moon which is

1202
02:01:34.621 --> 02:01:44.221
You see it is a partly contradiction because it has no lunar character at night at all.

1203
02:01:44.221 --> 02:01:48.541
A lot of fate is associated with the sun.

1204
02:01:48.541 --> 02:01:51.981
The same problem here.

1205
02:01:51.981 --> 02:01:55.801
And we have a desire that is associated between us.

1206
02:01:55.801 --> 02:01:56.721
A lot of love.

1207
02:01:57.094 --> 02:02:00.154
Which would make sense in some ways

1208
02:02:03.614 --> 02:02:10.034
But the lot of constraint or necessity is associated with mercury

1209
02:02:12.614 --> 02:02:14.974
Here I sense some

1210
02:02:17.134 --> 02:02:22.454
Dumbling of logic because I don't really

1211
02:02:22.958 --> 02:02:32.078
see the the the the the relationship the connection between Mercury and and necessity in any ways.

1212
02:02:33.038 --> 02:02:40.158
Yeah, and there are three more lots introduced for Mars Jupiter and Saturn the so called lots of

1213
02:02:40.158 --> 02:02:44.558
audacity victory and divine punishment.

1214
02:02:45.054 --> 02:02:47.614
Yeah, a lot of nemesis.

1215
02:02:47.614 --> 02:02:49.614
All right.

1216
02:02:49.614 --> 02:02:54.614
Okay, now let's look at the formulas.

1217
02:02:54.654 --> 02:02:55.494
Okay.

1218
02:02:57.054 --> 02:03:02.054
A lot of fortune is the usual one, a lot of fate is the usual one,

1219
02:03:03.534 --> 02:03:08.534
but a lot of desire and constraint are replaced with

1220
02:03:10.163 --> 02:03:15.163
some different lots.

1221
02:03:11.054 --> 02:03:12.054
a lot of

1222
02:03:15.283 --> 02:03:20.283
And then this format, Desire, is from Fate to Venus.

1223
02:03:23.643 --> 02:03:28.643
So let's see, we have Fate here, and we have Venus here.

1224
02:03:32.803 --> 02:03:38.803
So we will go to the next one.

1225
02:03:35.333 --> 02:03:43.973
from here to there yeah but because we are at night so we will have a reversed

1226
02:03:43.973 --> 02:03:53.353
version so we will come from Venus to to to fate and we will cause this and we

1227
02:03:53.353 --> 02:03:55.873
will find

1228
02:03:55.303 --> 02:03:59.143
the lot of desire a lot of lot here

1229
02:04:02.663 --> 02:04:05.663
Constraint is from from mercury to

1230
02:04:06.903 --> 02:04:10.463
Fortune so normally we would come from here

1231
02:04:11.463 --> 02:04:13.463
to fortune

1232
02:04:14.423 --> 02:04:19.703
Yeah, but here we also see some reversal so we will come from

1233
02:04:21.383 --> 02:04:23.383
Fortune to

1234
02:04:22.977 --> 02:04:29.297
"vacuary" which means that we need to project this interval from the sendent

1235
02:04:30.337 --> 02:04:38.977
and here we will have a lot of constraint. Here in this version you see that these

1236
02:04:41.217 --> 02:04:43.297
lots are symbolized by

1237
02:04:43.945 --> 02:04:53.625
circles in which you find the symbol of the associated planet. So here this is fortune,

1238
02:04:54.345 --> 02:05:04.985
this is fate, this is desire and love, this is constraint or necessity, this is divine punishment,

1239
02:05:04.985 --> 02:05:12.345
this is victory and this is bravery or audacity, whatever you like.

1240
02:05:12.864 --> 02:05:13.364
Yeah.

1241
02:05:16.784 --> 02:05:23.384
Now, as you see that desire is projected from fate

1242
02:05:23.384 --> 02:05:30.144
and constraint is projected to fortune,

1243
02:05:30.144 --> 02:05:42.824
this might suggest that whoever developed this scheme,

1244
02:05:36.488 --> 02:05:44.488
still remembered the relationship between fate and desire and fortune and constraint.

1245
02:05:44.488 --> 02:05:47.488
Maybe. I don't know.

1246
02:05:47.488 --> 02:05:59.488
But the thing is that if you look at the formulas a little bit closer,

1247
02:05:59.443 --> 02:06:11.443
Then it was discovered that the resulting, so the calculations are really odd.

1248
02:06:11.443 --> 02:06:13.443
Okay.

1249
02:06:13.443 --> 02:06:21.443
So if you look at the diurnal formula of desire.

1250
02:06:21.443 --> 02:06:22.443
Okay.

1251
02:06:22.093 --> 02:06:34.093
and you just resolve it. I mean you write down the formula and you write down okay what

1252
02:06:22.443 --> 02:06:23.443
So if you look at the diurnal formula of desire.

1253
02:06:23.443 --> 02:06:24.443
Okay.

1254
02:06:24.443 --> 02:06:25.443
So if you look at the diurnal formula of desire.

1255
02:06:25.443 --> 02:06:26.443
Okay.

1256
02:06:26.443 --> 02:06:27.443
So if you look at the diurnal formula of desire.

1257
02:06:27.443 --> 02:06:28.443
Okay.

1258
02:06:34.093 --> 02:06:46.253
it means to be fate. Then what you get is again a lunar phase indicator which is fine

1259
02:06:46.253 --> 02:06:47.253
but in this case

1260
02:06:47.253 --> 02:06:51.253
[no audio]

1261
02:06:48.257 --> 02:06:53.137
this is a lunar phase indicator projected from Venus.

1262
02:06:55.697 --> 02:07:02.737
Okay so this lunar phase indicator is not projected from the ascendant but it looks

1263
02:07:02.737 --> 02:07:11.777
it is like projected from Venus. Yeah so basically what I mean here is

1264
02:07:12.389 --> 02:07:24.549
that I can't show it to you now because this is a nocturnal chart but here is the sun and

1265
02:07:24.549 --> 02:07:30.589
here is the moon and this inter-wall is projected from

1266
02:07:30.589 --> 02:07:30.669
the moon.

1267
02:07:31.117 --> 02:07:41.917
Venus and this is how you actually get the the lot of desire and it is always

1268
02:07:41.917 --> 02:07:51.837
projected toward the the moon resulting in a lot

1269
02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:54.740
that is always very close to the Moon.

1270
02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:58.420
Actually, it is as close to the Moon

1271
02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:02.780
as Venus is close to the Sun.

1272
02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:09.900
And we know that the Venus Sun distance

1273
02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:14.480
cannot be bigger than 48 degrees.

1274
02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:17.620
It means that by day,

1275
02:08:18.051 --> 02:08:30.531
the hermetic lot of desire will be always in a maximum distance of 48 degrees from the Moon.

1276
02:08:31.411 --> 02:08:37.811
It is not seen here and that is just a coincidence that in this nocturnal chart you find

1277
02:08:38.771 --> 02:08:42.291
desire here but otherwise this is true.

1278
02:08:42.499 --> 02:08:54.499
What is also funny thing that the same applies to constraint but in this case everything works with Mercury.

1279
02:08:54.499 --> 02:09:00.499
And this is for the night version.

1280
02:09:00.499 --> 02:09:02.499
So here

1281
02:09:02.499 --> 02:09:04.499
we have the night version.

1282
02:09:02.676 --> 02:09:11.756
The lot of constraint is going to be a lunar phase indicator again.

1283
02:09:04.499 --> 02:09:10.499
And here we have the night version.

1284
02:09:11.756 --> 02:09:20.916
And this lot will always be very close to Mercury, sorry, to the Moon, as close as Mercury

1285
02:09:20.916 --> 02:09:28.796
must be close to the Sun, which is like 20,000 feet.

1286
02:09:25.901 --> 02:09:33.821
28 degrees, sometimes considerable less than 28 degrees.

1287
02:09:36.941 --> 02:09:41.821
So it is no surprise that you find mercury here.

1288
02:09:46.062 --> 02:09:50.502
Now, this is an interesting coincidence.

1289
02:09:50.502 --> 02:09:55.502
And this is the result of the fact that the ascendant

1290
02:09:59.182 --> 02:10:03.662
appears in the resolved formula twice,

1291
02:10:03.662 --> 02:10:07.282
but for the second occurrence,

1292
02:10:08.356 --> 02:10:15.156
the longitude of the ascendant is subtracted. So basically the ascendant

1293
02:10:15.156 --> 02:10:21.556
disappears from the formula and this is how you get these odd results.

1294
02:10:23.716 --> 02:10:26.436
And the fact

1295
02:10:27.068 --> 02:10:34.028
that there is a maximum elongation between the Sun and Venus and the Sun and Mercury

1296
02:10:37.548 --> 02:10:49.628
results or makes this, causes this odd result that these two lots are always close to the Moon.

1297
02:10:50.268 --> 02:10:50.668
I mean,

1298
02:10:51.490 --> 02:11:00.490
by always I mean that the desire by day and constraint by night is always close to the moon.

1299
02:11:00.490 --> 02:11:16.490
For the other lots, either the logic of desire or constraint are used.

1300
02:11:19.552 --> 02:11:29.552
victory which is a sort of a benefic lot let's say follows the logic of desire the lot of venus

1301
02:11:30.912 --> 02:11:36.512
and the malefic lots follow the logic of constraint

1302
02:11:36.676 --> 02:11:46.276
Now, this is something that was further analyzed by Chris Brennan in his article about the

1303
02:11:46.276 --> 02:11:49.556
rationals of lots.

1304
02:11:49.556 --> 02:11:57.916
So I don't really want to go on with this, but I just wanted to highlight that how odd

1305
02:11:57.916 --> 02:12:05.036
behavior these lots of desire and constraint have in some charts.

1306
02:12:04.128 --> 02:12:16.928
But speaking of this, I would also like to tell you what it means for the nocturnal charts

1307
02:12:16.928 --> 02:12:25.008
in the case of desire and diurnal charts in the case of constraint.

1308
02:12:25.008 --> 02:12:25.888
Now this is good.

1309
02:12:26.355 --> 02:12:32.915
at this time it is going to be really convoluted. So this is really going to be really complex.

1310
02:12:35.635 --> 02:12:47.075
In this case the inter-wall from the planet, I mean from Mercury or from Venus, is projected from

1311
02:12:47.075 --> 02:12:49.875
fortune or fate.

1312
02:12:50.463 --> 02:12:52.463
Yeah, so if you look

1313
02:12:54.203 --> 02:12:56.683
We are we have a nocturnal chart

1314
02:12:57.363 --> 02:13:00.143
So we will look at Venus

1315
02:13:00.683 --> 02:13:02.683
We will see

1316
02:13:03.243 --> 02:13:05.603
the the distance from

1317
02:13:06.723 --> 02:13:09.043
Venus to the ascendant

1318
02:13:09.782 --> 02:13:14.782
Okay, once again, Venus to the ascendance, right?

1319
02:13:16.942 --> 02:13:21.942
And we will project this interval from fate

1320
02:13:23.662 --> 02:13:27.142
because we are at night, so we will have this

1321
02:13:27.142 --> 02:13:32.142
and project this from fate, so that's how we will get this.

1322
02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:35.637
Okay.

1323
02:13:38.637 --> 02:13:42.637
Say if that was a Dianoid chart we could also play this with Mercury,

1324
02:13:42.637 --> 02:13:46.637
a project thing from Fortune.

1325
02:13:46.637 --> 02:13:50.637
But what we see here is that

1326
02:13:49.951 --> 02:13:51.431
that this is a mess.

1327
02:13:50.637 --> 02:14:00.637
the

1328
02:13:53.111 --> 02:13:56.131
This is a complete mess, right?

1329
02:13:57.591 --> 02:14:02.591
And what you really see here is that the diagonal version

1330
02:14:07.471 --> 02:14:12.471
of these lots, which look sort of nice and symmetrical

1331
02:14:14.351 --> 02:14:17.231
on the paper, if you just look at the formulas,

1332
02:14:17.865 --> 02:14:24.585
and the nocturnal behavior of these dots are completely different from each other.

1333
02:14:24.585 --> 02:14:34.905
So there is not even an explanation why the mercury should be associated with

1334
02:14:36.105 --> 02:14:41.705
a lot of constraint or necessity at all.

1335
02:14:42.245 --> 02:14:58.245
Yeah. And, and even if we even if we there are a lot of people who like this system that there are seven lots and they have really evocative names like victory and and courage and something like that.

1336
02:14:58.245 --> 02:15:02.245
Hmm.

1337
02:15:02.245 --> 02:15:06.245
It seems that the people who develop that.

1338
02:15:06.245 --> 02:15:11.245
Yeah.

1339
02:15:07.207 --> 02:15:12.207
had already forgotten any sort of logic

1340
02:15:14.207 --> 02:15:16.967
that can be behind the lots.

1341
02:15:16.967 --> 02:15:18.967
So it was just a combination that,

1342
02:15:18.967 --> 02:15:22.927
okay, maybe we remember that a desire

1343
02:15:22.927 --> 02:15:25.727
has something to do with fate.

1344
02:15:25.727 --> 02:15:30.727
Okay, so let's put fate into this formula.

1345
02:15:30.767 --> 02:15:34.727
And we also go that, okay,

1346
02:15:35.637 --> 02:15:45.317
If the third lot is the lot of love and it should be associated with the Venus, then there is mercury

1347
02:15:45.317 --> 02:15:51.397
missing, so mercury should be associated with a necessity, a constraint, and we should use

1348
02:15:53.957 --> 02:15:56.917
fortune in its formula or something like that.

1349
02:15:57.367 --> 02:15:59.287
And then came the other one.

1350
02:16:00.847 --> 02:16:03.727
And the other one and the other one,

1351
02:16:03.727 --> 02:16:08.727
so finally resulting in this whole set of seven lots.

1352
02:16:12.207 --> 02:16:13.727
Okay, I don't know,

1353
02:16:14.887 --> 02:16:18.247
but it looks really, really artificial for me.

1354
02:16:18.247 --> 02:16:20.487
Maybe you say that it is not so artificial,

1355
02:16:20.487 --> 02:16:22.807
for me it looks like very artificial.

1356
02:16:24.167 --> 02:16:25.287
And the thing is,

1357
02:16:25.279 --> 02:16:34.959
that apart from this horoscope that I mentioned that was cast for 318 sorry 19 and 18 that's 19

1358
02:16:35.599 --> 02:16:45.919
right apart from this horoscope where it is just tabulated and no interpretation is found we never

1359
02:16:45.919 --> 02:16:49.999
see this

1360
02:16:47.187 --> 02:16:57.587
this scheme in any other horoscopes. So it looks like that was a tradition with a sort of limited

1361
02:16:57.587 --> 02:17:06.947
success that was now in some places in Egypt. It was now to Paulus and from Paulus it was borrowed

1362
02:17:06.947 --> 02:17:13.267
by others like Olympiodorus and before him by Vitorius who basically repeats

1363
02:17:13.907 --> 02:17:14.627
in

1364
02:17:14.031 --> 02:17:23.871
everything related to these lots from polis. And somehow this lore was also transmitted to the

1365
02:17:14.627 --> 02:17:16.387
the

1366
02:17:24.751 --> 02:17:35.871
to Islamic test Rogers because vestiges of this system are found discovered in

1367
02:17:35.871 --> 02:17:40.671
in Islamic sources like Abu Ma'sharf's introduction.

1368
02:17:41.144 --> 02:17:52.624
Okay, so these were the lots as we can see the gradual development.

1369
02:17:52.624 --> 02:18:01.984
Only fortune, then fortune and fate, then the four lots and the system of seven lots.

1370
02:18:01.984 --> 02:18:02.824
What remains?

1371
02:18:03.003 --> 02:18:09.163
is going to be really, really shorter. First, I would like to talk about personal lots and

1372
02:18:11.563 --> 02:18:19.723
their problems especially. And then I will just go through the main issues with the other

1373
02:18:21.163 --> 02:18:24.523
lots to get to the conclusion. So.

1374
02:18:24.945 --> 02:18:26.645
Let's see.

1375
02:18:26.645 --> 02:18:27.525
Personal lots.

1376
02:18:27.525 --> 02:18:32.525
By personal lots, I mean the lots of father, mother,

1377
02:18:33.885 --> 02:18:37.205
siblings, children, marriage, and illness

1378
02:18:37.205 --> 02:18:40.785
that are discovered in a number of sources.

1379
02:18:43.365 --> 02:18:47.045
I just chose these ones because these appear

1380
02:18:47.045 --> 02:18:50.765
in more than, so in multiple,

1381
02:18:51.105 --> 02:19:03.025
sources that are not related to each other. Maybe we could add a lot of slaves, that is Mercury,

1382
02:19:03.025 --> 02:19:12.385
Moon, Lot, and that which is also found in unrelated sources in Dorotheus and Firmicus.

1383
02:19:13.425 --> 02:19:13.505
But

1384
02:19:14.905 --> 02:19:29.145
These are the seven lots that are commonly found in different sources, different Hellenistic sources.

1385
02:19:30.145 --> 02:19:33.145
And I call them personal lots because

1386
02:19:33.435 --> 02:19:38.435
we see the overlap between the meaning of these,

1387
02:19:40.995 --> 02:19:45.995
the names of these lots and some indications of the places.

1388
02:19:50.832 --> 02:20:01.872
topics associated with the places. Because we have places of illness, we have a place of illness,

1389
02:20:01.872 --> 02:20:08.032
we have a place of marriage, we have place of children, we have place of siblings, and we have

1390
02:20:08.032 --> 02:20:09.712
a place of parents.

1391
02:20:09.942 --> 02:20:14.942
even if there is no separate place for father and the mother,

1392
02:20:19.022 --> 02:20:24.022
still it looks like these core lots

1393
02:20:26.102 --> 02:20:30.102
are for the same topics

1394
02:20:32.102 --> 02:20:36.522
that are also analyzed through the places.

1395
02:20:36.664 --> 02:20:54.664
Okay, there is only one thing I just want to mention related to this, that you know there is this later tradition I guess, that's an Islamica tradition that associates the seventh place with the mother.

1396
02:20:54.664 --> 02:20:56.664
Mm-hmm.

1397
02:20:56.310 --> 02:20:59.710
This is a misunderstanding.

1398
02:20:59.710 --> 02:21:10.050
So basically, I think this is a misunderstanding of Ptolemy's obscure words, which in the chapter

1399
02:21:10.050 --> 02:21:20.510
on siblings says that what he says basically is like looking at the children of the mother

1400
02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:22.870
and and in this description.

1401
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:25.870
It.

1402
02:21:23.036 --> 02:21:36.796
it sounds like he wants to look at the seventh place, so the mid heaven for the mother, but it

1403
02:21:36.796 --> 02:21:43.916
is not true. Actually what he says is that from the mother's place we look at the mid heaven because

1404
02:21:46.156 --> 02:21:48.316
this place will symbolize

1405
02:21:50.162 --> 02:21:55.162
the children of the mother, so basically siblings.

1406
02:21:55.162 --> 02:22:04.162
But still, this is a very strong tradition in Islamic astrology and early modern astrology,

1407
02:22:04.162 --> 02:22:13.162
and even in modern traditional astrology that the father is the fourth place and the mother is the tenth.

1408
02:22:13.162 --> 02:22:15.162
[pause]

1409
02:22:14.852 --> 02:22:24.852
This didn't exist in Hellenistic astrology, so parents belonged to the fourth place.

1410
02:22:15.162 --> 02:22:19.162
[silence]

1411
02:22:24.852 --> 02:22:34.852
Of course, there was another tradition that associated the father with the ninth place, but this is found only in Valence.

1412
02:22:34.852 --> 02:22:40.852
So going back to the mainstream,

1413
02:22:40.625 --> 02:22:51.625
These are some personal lots and these personal lots are all projected from the ascendant.

1414
02:22:51.625 --> 02:22:59.625
And in these personal lots we can discover the use of basically all the planets but Mercury.

1415
02:22:59.943 --> 02:23:07.943
So in the case of father, the projection is from the distances from the sun to Saturn, and this is reversed.

1416
02:23:07.943 --> 02:23:12.943
For the mother, from Venus to the moon, and it is reversed.

1417
02:23:12.943 --> 02:23:20.943
For the siblings, from Saturn to Jupiter, and in some sources it is reversed.

1418
02:23:20.943 --> 02:23:23.943
In other sources, it is not reversed.

1419
02:23:23.575 --> 02:23:27.175
or children from Jupiter to Saturn.

1420
02:23:27.175 --> 02:23:32.175
And again, there is a different opinion between sources,

1421
02:23:35.335 --> 02:23:37.655
whether it should be reversed or not.

1422
02:23:37.655 --> 02:23:41.855
The same reversing question occurs for the marriage

1423
02:23:41.855 --> 02:23:46.855
for men and women, for the marriage for men,

1424
02:23:48.335 --> 02:23:50.935
the distances from Saturn to Venus,

1425
02:23:50.935 --> 02:23:52.935
for women from Venus to Saturn,

1426
02:23:52.857 --> 02:24:04.857
And for illness it is fine, it is reversed and from Saturn to Mars the Dyna formula is this way.

1427
02:24:04.857 --> 02:24:11.857
So it is very nice. Now let's try to look at the logic, what we can make of it.

1428
02:24:16.243 --> 02:24:21.243
I think it is, we can state that the idea behind the

1429
02:24:25.523 --> 02:24:29.123
formulas of father and mother,

1430
02:24:29.123 --> 02:24:32.983
that we say without the lot of, so father and mother,

1431
02:24:34.388 --> 02:24:39.388
clearly come from the logic of fortune.

1432
02:24:40.668 --> 02:24:45.668
Because there are some planetary significator

1433
02:24:48.588 --> 02:24:52.268
associated with the parents.

1434
02:24:52.268 --> 02:24:57.268
These planetary significators are used in these formulas.

1435
02:24:59.268 --> 02:25:03.388
So that is sun and Saturn for father,

1436
02:25:03.516 --> 02:25:12.876
and Venus and Moon are for the mother. So what we see here is that the light that is associated

1437
02:25:12.876 --> 02:25:22.716
with the parent remains in the formula in the place where it is and the other one is replaced

1438
02:25:23.436 --> 02:25:26.876
with the other planet associated with the parent.

1439
02:25:27.519 --> 02:25:43.039
So if we go back for a moment, the lot of fortune is from the sun to the moon, so the

1440
02:25:43.039 --> 02:25:48.879
sun remains but the moon is replaced with Saturn for the father.

1441
02:25:49.239 --> 02:25:57.359
But for the mother, the moon remains and the sun is replaced with Venus.

1442
02:25:57.359 --> 02:26:05.359
And of course we reverse it as we reverse the Lot of Fortune.

1443
02:26:05.359 --> 02:26:13.639
So I would say that this is quite straightforward and we can also say that

1444
02:26:13.639 --> 02:26:18.639
...

1445
02:26:15.873 --> 02:26:20.873
that the logic was sort of consistent in this case.

1446
02:26:26.013 --> 02:26:29.253
The same consistent thinking is tested

1447
02:26:29.253 --> 02:26:34.253
in the case of illness in which the lights

1448
02:26:35.293 --> 02:26:40.293
are not visible, but the light is visible.

1449
02:26:35.616 --> 02:26:41.856
both lights are replaced with the malefic of the faction

1450
02:26:41.293 --> 02:26:43.293
So the light is visible,

1451
02:26:43.293 --> 02:26:45.293
but the light is visible.

1452
02:26:43.856 --> 02:26:47.376
identical to the light

1453
02:26:48.656 --> 02:26:50.336
so once again

1454
02:26:53.696 --> 02:26:54.736
normally

1455
02:26:57.216 --> 02:27:02.896
we would have a fortune from the sun to the moon

1456
02:27:03.177 --> 02:27:19.177
we replace the Sun with the diurnal malefic which is Saturn and we replace the Nocturnal Moon with the Nocturnal malefic with Mars.

1457
02:27:19.177 --> 02:27:23.177
So we have illness which is a reverse lot.

1458
02:27:23.177 --> 02:27:27.177
It makes sense because

1459
02:27:27.048 --> 02:27:42.408
If lights, if the lights are associated with life and health and sickness of course, and

1460
02:27:42.408 --> 02:27:48.528
wealth and poverty in general.

1461
02:27:48.970 --> 02:28:04.970
then the malefics should focus on the negative side of this, especially when it comes to the enemy of life, which is illness.

1462
02:28:06.970 --> 02:28:09.970
The enemy of health, I would say.

1463
02:28:09.970 --> 02:28:13.970
The question also occurs that why...

1464
02:28:13.856 --> 02:28:18.856
Is there not a corresponding lot with the benefits?

1465
02:28:19.496 --> 02:28:24.496
Why we don't have a lot that is from Jupiter to Venus

1466
02:28:24.496 --> 02:28:26.616
and reverse by by night.

1467
02:28:26.616 --> 02:28:31.136
Well, actually we have not only one under one name,

1468
02:28:31.136 --> 02:28:33.856
but on the multiple names,

1469
02:28:33.856 --> 02:28:35.416
but it looks like

1470
02:28:37.675 --> 02:28:47.835
In the sources that we have, there was not a popular lot that went under this formula,

1471
02:28:47.835 --> 02:28:54.075
which is basically the same formula.

1472
02:28:54.075 --> 02:29:00.275
If we look at the major versions, it's the same formula as violence's marriage lot would

1473
02:29:00.275 --> 02:29:00.595
be.

1474
02:29:01.035 --> 02:29:10.035
Yeah, but it is also possible that this violence is marriage lot that is from Jupiter to Venus

1475
02:29:10.035 --> 02:29:21.515
is corrupt in the manuscripts because otherwise than the usual lot formula for marriage lot

1476
02:29:21.515 --> 02:29:22.995
is from Saturn.

1477
02:29:23.391 --> 02:29:28.511
to Venus and not from Jupiter to Venus. So Valens is either

1478
02:29:31.071 --> 02:29:40.031
decenter and he has some different idea or the otherwise quite corrupted Valens manuscript

1479
02:29:40.031 --> 02:29:46.191
has Valens slot in the wrong way. I don't know. We can discuss this.

1480
02:29:47.064 --> 02:29:57.744
Okay. Okay, but let's move on and let's see what else we have.

1481
02:29:57.744 --> 02:30:02.144
Marriage. The marriage laws.

1482
02:30:02.258 --> 02:30:09.858
If you look at the marriage lots for women and men, you see that basically these are

1483
02:30:09.858 --> 02:30:16.818
the same but in reversed version. So that's why I guess there are some authors who say that

1484
02:30:17.858 --> 02:30:23.058
if basically these two lots are the reversed versions of each other,

1485
02:30:23.362 --> 02:30:29.522
then they shouldn't be reversed by night. So we should stay with from Saturn to Venus

1486
02:30:30.562 --> 02:30:36.642
for men by night and we should do the same for the women's lot.

1487
02:30:38.642 --> 02:30:42.562
But of course it is not something that everybody agrees with.

1488
02:30:42.858 --> 02:30:54.198
But what if we look at these formulas closer, what we see is that the true planets associated

1489
02:30:54.198 --> 02:30:57.598
with the parents are used.

1490
02:30:57.598 --> 02:30:58.978
Okay.

1491
02:30:58.978 --> 02:31:06.458
So you know, the non-luminary for the father is Saturn.

1492
02:31:06.458 --> 02:31:12.578
The non-luminary for the mother is Venus.

1493
02:31:42.271 --> 02:31:45.471
marriage lots. Okay.

1494
02:31:45.471 --> 02:31:50.071
Non reversing works to show how or under what circumstances the couple meet.

1495
02:31:50.391 --> 02:31:54.631
Yeah, that, that makes sense. I would say that, um, and the,

1496
02:31:55.351 --> 02:32:00.271
the logic of these lots, um, uh, suggests that, um, these,

1497
02:32:00.311 --> 02:32:01.151
um,

1498
02:32:01.207 --> 02:32:08.207
lot pairs, so at least for man, for we can say it for marriage, non reversing would be

1499
02:32:08.207 --> 02:32:17.527
would be more beneficial than than reversing. Anyways, it is interesting to see that in

1500
02:32:17.527 --> 02:32:26.287
this marriage lot, the true planets associated with the parents are used. So we have natural

1501
02:32:29.698 --> 02:32:37.218
of women and men in general and whereas in the case of women the natural significator

1502
02:32:37.218 --> 02:32:45.938
be Venus it's okay but the natural significator of man is not Saturn but the Sun. So

1503
02:32:45.698 --> 02:32:45.938
um

1504
02:32:47.641 --> 02:33:06.641
This is interesting why in a marriage lot, not, let's say, not men and women are represented in this way, but more like in some ways potential parents.

1505
02:33:06.651 --> 02:33:32.651
But maybe we could say that this is because the marriage lot was intended to be not a lot of marriage in the sense of romantic partnership, but in the sense of reproducing under a legal framework.

1506
02:33:38.212 --> 02:33:40.532
So this is an interesting thing here.

1507
02:33:43.252 --> 02:33:52.292
It's also interesting to think about it, to speculate whether if valence is a marriage lot.

1508
02:33:52.585 --> 02:34:01.465
with Jupiter is genuine and he really intended this then why Jupiter here? That's uh I don't have any

1509
02:34:02.825 --> 02:34:11.065
answers to this question so I can only say I don't know I've got no real idea for that

1510
02:34:12.665 --> 02:34:15.385
okay but if we go on um

1511
02:34:17.796 --> 02:34:32.916
Yeah, if we go on, right.

1512
02:34:32.916 --> 02:34:47.156
Then some, we can see some logic in this whole system, but we will see that, you know,

1513
02:34:46.046 --> 02:34:53.686
with the siblings and children will also encounter some problems.

1514
02:34:53.686 --> 02:35:03.006
The logic in general, at least for these lots we have seen, I mean for lots of the parents,

1515
02:35:03.006 --> 02:35:06.966
for marriage lots and for illness, looks like that

1516
02:35:06.966 --> 02:35:15.966
the parents are not going to be able to do anything about it.

1517
02:35:07.482 --> 02:35:15.522
If there are two planets associated with a certain concept or certain person, like the

1518
02:35:15.522 --> 02:35:27.562
malefics with illness or Venus and the moon with the mother, then in the lot formula both

1519
02:35:27.562 --> 02:35:31.442
these planets must be featured.

1520
02:35:31.844 --> 02:35:54.844
And the logic should follow the logic of the Lot of Fortune in the way that if the if the these two planets belong to different factions,

1521
02:35:54.844 --> 02:35:56.844
then the two planets are not the same.

1522
02:35:55.282 --> 02:36:09.282
So like Saturn is diurnal and Mars is nocturnal, then the diurnal formula will be from the diurnal planet to the nocturnal planet and by night, reversely.

1523
02:35:56.844 --> 02:36:00.844
and the logic should follow the logic of the Lot of Fortune in the way that if the if the these two planets belong to different factions,

1524
02:36:09.282 --> 02:36:13.282
But if the factions are the same,

1525
02:36:13.722 --> 02:36:22.442
like in the case of a lot of Mother because the two planets associated with the Mother are the Moon and Venus

1526
02:36:23.642 --> 02:36:26.042
and both are Nocturnal planets.

1527
02:36:27.162 --> 02:36:37.642
Then in the formula we also again imitate the formula of Fortune.

1528
02:36:37.583 --> 02:36:42.583
but the moon remains in its place or in her place.

1529
02:36:44.783 --> 02:36:49.783
So it's going to be to the moon and from the other planet.

1530
02:36:51.003 --> 02:36:54.263
Of course, a question occurs that what can we do

1531
02:36:54.263 --> 02:36:59.263
if following this logic,

1532
02:36:59.784 --> 02:37:07.064
this we are trying to extend this that following this logic we have let's say whatever concept we

1533
02:36:59.823 --> 02:37:06.823
if following this logic,

1534
02:37:07.064 --> 02:37:21.144
have on our mind has two planets two associated planets but they belong to the same faction

1535
02:37:21.729 --> 02:37:27.289
to the same sect, but neither is light,

1536
02:37:27.289 --> 02:37:32.329
then how should we work with them?

1537
02:37:32.329 --> 02:37:35.089
This is one problem.

1538
02:37:35.089 --> 02:37:38.169
But the other thing is that if there

1539
02:37:38.169 --> 02:37:41.769
is a single planet that is associated with a concept,

1540
02:37:41.769 --> 02:37:43.769
then we can't do anything about it.

1541
02:37:42.195 --> 02:37:55.195
And I would say that this might be the case for the marriage lot.

1542
02:37:43.769 --> 02:37:51.609
So we can't do anything about it.

1543
02:37:55.195 --> 02:37:59.195
And I would say that in the marriage lot,

1544
02:37:59.195 --> 02:38:02.195
this is the case for the marriage lot.

1545
02:38:02.195 --> 02:38:05.195
And I would say that in the marriage lot,

1546
02:38:02.224 --> 02:38:09.784
A single planet would be a planet that is associated with the wife or associated with

1547
02:38:05.195 --> 02:38:08.195
this is the case for the marriage lot.

1548
02:38:08.195 --> 02:38:11.195
And I would say that in the marriage lot,

1549
02:38:09.784 --> 02:38:15.504
the husband.

1550
02:38:15.504 --> 02:38:26.344
Then we present both parties in the formula.

1551
02:38:23.112 --> 02:38:27.452
in the way that for the marriage for men,

1552
02:38:27.452 --> 02:38:31.652
we look from husband to wife

1553
02:38:32.652 --> 02:38:37.652
and for wives from wife to husband.

1554
02:38:43.852 --> 02:38:48.852
Yeah, but this would work only if we could find

1555
02:38:49.948 --> 02:38:58.948
reasonable explanation for the presence of Saturn which stands here for the Sun.

1556
02:38:58.948 --> 02:39:07.948
But I also mentioned that the logic might be that in this case we also see

1557
02:39:07.581 --> 02:39:17.701
two planets. And these two planets are basically parent planets here. So basically what we

1558
02:39:17.701 --> 02:39:22.941
see here for the marriage lot is not the marriage lot in the sense that it is not about a romantic

1559
02:39:22.941 --> 02:39:30.221
partnership, but it's about the survival of the human species maybe.

1560
02:39:30.587 --> 02:39:56.587
There can be other explanations why Saturn is presented here. Other explanations can include the problem that if it was a lot from the Sun to Venus, it would limit the

1561
02:39:50.446 --> 02:40:00.046
the position in the horoscope because we know that it would mean that let's say

1562
02:40:01.166 --> 02:40:09.326
this marriage lot would always fall into a sign, into a degree which is close to the ascendant,

1563
02:40:10.366 --> 02:40:15.086
not farther than 48 degrees.

1564
02:40:15.716 --> 02:40:33.716
which basically means that these lots would always fall into the 11th, 12th, 1st, 2nd or 3rd places and not to any other places.

1565
02:40:33.716 --> 02:40:41.716
But this speculation is contradicted by the fact that Valence has

1566
02:40:42.493 --> 02:40:47.493
his own special marriage lots.

1567
02:40:47.493 --> 02:41:03.493
And for the marriage of men, he does use a lot that is taken from the Sun to Venus.

1568
02:41:03.723 --> 02:41:12.723
And he does, he makes a similar lot with Mars and the moon for women.

1569
02:41:12.723 --> 02:41:25.723
Which is an interesting thing, and I don't really want to go on speculating on this, but if we compare these two lots, then in the case of the

1570
02:41:25.723 --> 02:41:31.723
the

1571
02:41:26.148 --> 02:41:35.308
a lot of marriage for men, the featuring Venus and the Sun shows that it's something like

1572
02:41:35.308 --> 02:41:47.628
about women-men social relationship, so as it is seen on the level of the society.

1573
02:41:47.628 --> 02:41:50.748
But if it is, if we look at the,

1574
02:41:50.798 --> 02:42:00.798
the female counterpart of that, the lot of marriage for women with Mars and the Moon,

1575
02:42:00.798 --> 02:42:08.798
it looks like it's more like a sexual lot, which is about

1576
02:42:08.798 --> 02:42:10.798
about

1577
02:42:10.798 --> 02:42:14.798
actual

1578
02:42:14.577 --> 02:42:27.577
impregnation, fertilization or something like that with Mars and the moon representing male and female sexuality.

1579
02:42:14.798 --> 02:42:18.798
...

1580
02:42:27.577 --> 02:42:41.577
Anyways, it is really speculative to talk about the logic of these lots if the pool is so small.

1581
02:42:41.634 --> 02:42:54.234
So these are just my attempts to try and see some logic in the formulas.

1582
02:42:54.234 --> 02:43:01.674
But if we look at the lots of siblings and children, I guess that

1583
02:43:01.674 --> 02:43:02.674
--

1584
02:43:02.588 --> 02:43:08.988
Maybe I'm wrong, but we run out of logical explanations.

1585
02:43:02.674 --> 02:43:10.674
[Pause]

1586
02:43:12.508 --> 02:43:24.508
As you have seen, these lots for siblings and children are Saturn-Jupiter lots,

1587
02:43:24.508 --> 02:43:27.148
and these are reversed versions of each other.

1588
02:43:27.717 --> 02:43:34.717
Now, the question occurs for children.

1589
02:43:34.717 --> 02:43:46.717
Okay, for children Jupiter is an apt significator because Jupiter in general is associated with children.

1590
02:43:46.717 --> 02:43:53.717
It is associated with fertility and that's why it is also

1591
02:43:55.120 --> 02:44:03.280
a significator of children or blessing of children. But what does Saturn do here? If

1592
02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:18.400
we say that we should look at a relationship between potential children and their parents,

1593
02:44:19.053 --> 02:44:33.913
Then why not say from Sun to Jupiter, from Father to Children or from Saturn to Jupiter

1594
02:44:33.913 --> 02:44:37.353
and why from Jupiter to Saturn in this case?

1595
02:44:37.847 --> 02:44:44.847
Not to speak about the fact that if this is a female nativity, then of course we should

1596
02:44:44.847 --> 02:44:56.247
look at a lot from the mother to children, like from the moon or Venus to Jupiter.

1597
02:44:56.247 --> 02:45:03.367
But why the opposite way?

1598
02:45:03.367 --> 02:45:07.767
I guess that the problem is even deeper when we come to the siblings.

1599
02:45:07.162 --> 02:45:19.962
And okay, normally, if we talk about siblings in the sense of, of brothers, normally, the primary

1600
02:45:19.962 --> 02:45:28.762
planetary significator is Mars. But especially if it is about younger brothers, then Mercury also

1601
02:45:29.322 --> 02:45:32.522
can play this role. So this is neither

1602
02:45:33.215 --> 02:45:44.175
Saturn or Jupiter? Actually, Saturn maybe could play the role of a significator of an elder brother.

1603
02:45:44.895 --> 02:45:53.215
Yeah, especially a much elder brother, right? But still nothing really explains why it is a

1604
02:45:53.215 --> 02:45:57.855
lot that is cast from Saturn to Jupiter.

1605
02:45:58.358 --> 02:46:03.078
And why are they pairs of each other?

1606
02:46:03.078 --> 02:46:10.758
Because in the case of marriage for women and marriage for men, it's okay to see that

1607
02:46:10.758 --> 02:46:17.118
basically we're talking about the different sides of the same issue, the same concept.

1608
02:46:17.118 --> 02:46:18.118
But

1609
02:46:18.366 --> 02:46:28.366
being having siblings, having children are are conceptually very different things.

1610
02:46:28.366 --> 02:46:38.366
So if they are if they are each other's counterparts, then I could also speculate then.

1611
02:46:38.366 --> 02:46:44.366
Okay, then to focus on the most important family relations and

1612
02:46:44.366 --> 02:46:47.366
and

1613
02:46:45.452 --> 02:46:54.412
Why aren't wives and mothers are counterparts of each other, maybe, or husbands and fathers, let's say.

1614
02:46:57.532 --> 02:47:10.972
So, speculating for some more logical lot possibilities for brothers,

1615
02:47:14.959 --> 02:47:22.159
a lot from Mercury to Mars because Mercury is the non-nocturnal

1616
02:47:23.839 --> 02:47:31.519
natural significator and Mars is the nocturnal significator that would work perfectly.

1617
02:47:32.319 --> 02:47:35.439
I don't really want to suggest that oh this is the right version

1618
02:47:36.021 --> 02:47:49.141
I just want to show you that somehow, and maybe this is an illusion, it looks like there

1619
02:47:49.141 --> 02:47:55.461
were many, many strata in the development of the lots.

1620
02:47:55.461 --> 02:48:00.021
And whereas we can see in some cases that

1621
02:48:01.784 --> 02:48:16.424
If our reconstructed logic for the lot of fortune and for the derived lots is something to be trusted,

1622
02:48:17.384 --> 02:48:28.584
then we can see then in some strata the logic of the other lots were close to this logic or was

1623
02:48:30.279 --> 02:48:40.279
But in other strata, different considerations were employed.

1624
02:48:40.279 --> 02:48:47.199
And in some cases, me, I can speak of myself.

1625
02:48:47.199 --> 02:48:53.119
I am unable to crack the logic of these inventions.

1626
02:48:53.119 --> 02:48:54.719
And this is true for

1627
02:48:54.719 --> 02:48:55.719
the

1628
02:48:56.079 --> 02:49:00.079
the

1629
02:48:56.313 --> 02:48:59.613
for the lots of siblings and children.

1630
02:49:00.873 --> 02:49:05.073
And partly it is also true for the seven hermetic lots.

1631
02:49:08.253 --> 02:49:09.093
Yeah.

1632
02:49:10.073 --> 02:49:13.673
So all in all, what I would like to say is that

1633
02:49:13.673 --> 02:49:15.193
if someone

1634
02:49:15.868 --> 02:49:34.988
is seeking a sort of a universal logic that could be employed for all lot formulas, then

1635
02:49:34.988 --> 02:49:35.988
this person will

1636
02:49:35.988 --> 02:49:36.108
[pause]

1637
02:49:36.591 --> 02:49:47.591
it will be disappointed because it looks like there never was solitary universal logic for lots.

1638
02:49:49.591 --> 02:50:00.591
So it also means that it would be pointless to move on and to look at other lot formulas because

1639
02:50:00.591 --> 02:50:01.591
there are

1640
02:50:02.006 --> 02:50:04.506
hundreds of lot formulas.

1641
02:50:05.906 --> 02:50:09.806
And if even if we focus on Hellenistic formulas, then we

1642
02:50:09.806 --> 02:50:17.806
will have at least 100 different lots, which might be partly

1643
02:50:17.806 --> 02:50:19.406
might be later maybe.

1644
02:50:21.506 --> 02:50:24.906
So I would like to focus on the most important things only.

1645
02:50:25.230 --> 02:50:30.230
So this is going to be the beginning of the end

1646
02:50:32.270 --> 02:50:35.150
of my presentation, which is really timely.

1647
02:50:38.370 --> 02:50:43.370
So if we, and the first thing is that the so-called

1648
02:50:46.130 --> 02:50:50.750
trivial lots and by trivial lots, I mean the ones

1649
02:50:50.750 --> 02:50:52.230
that feature

1650
02:50:52.653 --> 02:51:06.013
the planets in the formula. There are 42 possible combinations with the seven planets. And

1651
02:51:07.373 --> 02:51:13.453
each of these possible combinations are used for formulas for multiple lots.

1652
02:51:15.272 --> 02:51:23.272
By multiple lots I mean that there are different names, different areas of suggested use.

1653
02:51:23.272 --> 02:51:36.272
We don't know if they were used in this way or not because the use of these trivial lots in actual surviving horoscopes is very limited.

1654
02:51:36.877 --> 02:51:47.637
Yeah, but in many cases we really see that these lot formulas follow arbitrary logic.

1655
02:51:47.637 --> 02:51:55.757
So local logic maybe, or they don't follow any discernible logic.

1656
02:51:55.757 --> 02:51:59.177
There are also opposite lots, which is like

1657
02:51:59.177 --> 02:52:00.177
a

1658
02:51:59.750 --> 02:52:14.170
There are no individual lots, but the oppositions of existing lots are used to analyze something.

1659
02:52:03.657 --> 02:52:06.657
a

1660
02:52:14.170 --> 02:52:22.230
You have seen this because I mentioned them in my first presentation for the foster father,

1661
02:52:22.230 --> 02:52:24.630
for adultery, and for the usurper.

1662
02:52:25.078 --> 02:52:35.078
which were the opposites of the lots of the father, the lots of marriage, the lot of marriage, and the lot of the king.

1663
02:52:45.078 --> 02:52:51.078
Sorry. There are many alternative formulas for the same

1664
02:52:51.339 --> 02:52:57.419
lot. I mean, there is a name that a lot of something a lot of purchase maybe.

1665
02:52:59.659 --> 02:53:07.179
And in different sources, you can see different, sometimes radically different lot formulas.

1666
02:53:09.259 --> 02:53:16.619
And in many cases, maybe you can, you can suspect that these are the results of some

1667
02:53:20.918 --> 02:53:35.478
always the best explanation. What is even more surprising that even there are some alternative

1668
02:53:35.478 --> 02:53:39.478
formulas for well-established personal lots.

1669
02:53:39.811 --> 02:53:53.811
So sometimes we have an author who says that there is a different lot of father, lot of mother,

1670
02:53:53.811 --> 02:53:58.811
not for the lot of mother actually, but a lot of father, lot of children.

1671
02:53:58.811 --> 02:54:08.811
[no audio]

1672
02:54:00.212 --> 02:54:03.552
lot of siblings, lot of marriage,

1673
02:54:03.552 --> 02:54:07.432
multiple lots for marriage from different perspective,

1674
02:54:07.432 --> 02:54:08.292
things like that.

1675
02:54:09.392 --> 02:54:14.392
So it looks like there was no access to some common sources,

1676
02:54:21.409 --> 02:54:26.409
But they were still eager to derive their own lots.

1677
02:54:26.409 --> 02:54:32.409
And this is quite obvious that they had different understandings.

1678
02:54:32.409 --> 02:54:39.409
What is also interesting is that there are some lots, there are some

1679
02:54:39.409 --> 02:54:50.409
...

1680
02:54:41.008 --> 02:54:45.208
some inexplicable gaps, I would say.

1681
02:54:46.608 --> 02:54:51.128
So whereas there are lots of many different things

1682
02:54:51.128 --> 02:54:53.968
which are even difficult to translate

1683
02:54:53.968 --> 02:54:58.968
because there is no context for these words

1684
02:55:01.008 --> 02:55:04.068
and we don't know in what sense they are basically used.

1685
02:55:04.299 --> 02:55:18.019
So that's why in different translations of the same lots exist in different editions,

1686
02:55:18.019 --> 02:55:26.259
different translations of the same text can feature really different interpretations.

1687
02:55:27.438 --> 02:55:37.438
But still, there are for example no now lots of sisters, no now lots of grandparents,

1688
02:55:38.158 --> 02:55:42.798
other significant family relations and things like that.

1689
02:55:46.158 --> 02:55:56.798
um

1690
02:55:49.699 --> 02:55:55.539
So yeah, so we have many, many, many, many interesting lots

1691
02:55:55.539 --> 02:55:58.099
and they pose their own problems.

1692
02:56:04.459 --> 02:56:09.739
Now, I mentioned that these other lots--

1693
02:56:10.493 --> 02:56:15.493
are really rarely found in horoscopic examples.

1694
02:56:19.893 --> 02:56:22.053
And if we look at the original documents,

1695
02:56:22.053 --> 02:56:25.973
so horoscopes surviving in Papyri,

1696
02:56:28.413 --> 02:56:33.413
then all we can find is an unreversed marriage lot,

1697
02:56:35.293 --> 02:56:38.653
which is found in one Egypt,

1698
02:56:38.624 --> 02:56:48.464
Egyptian papyrus and which might have been found into others which are true fragmentary.

1699
02:56:50.224 --> 02:56:55.104
Maybe a lot of activity can be found but it is uncertain.

1700
02:56:57.024 --> 02:57:02.064
And there is one papyrus where in which many different lots

1701
02:57:02.653 --> 02:57:07.653
were listed, but actually we can't really identify them.

1702
02:57:09.333 --> 02:57:14.333
So because this papyrus is broken.

1703
02:57:21.573 --> 02:57:26.373
If we look at literary horoscopes,

1704
02:57:27.533 --> 02:57:31.673
which are found in the works of different authors,

1705
02:57:31.845 --> 02:57:43.205
Then basically these other lots of these other lots, so not the four principal lots and things

1706
02:57:43.205 --> 02:57:45.985
like that.

1707
02:57:45.985 --> 02:57:51.445
And the ones that I mentioned also the seven hermetic lots featured in one horoscope.

1708
02:57:52.264 --> 02:58:05.184
Then the sole example what we find in Hellenistic horoscopes proper is Dorotheus' siblings in

1709
02:58:05.184 --> 02:58:08.324
one horoscope of his.

1710
02:58:08.324 --> 02:58:18.744
But fortunately we have the Emperor Constantine's nativity where many of Dorotheus' lots are

1711
02:58:18.744 --> 02:58:19.744
used.

1712
02:58:19.486 --> 02:58:24.486
in the interpretation so we can at least study their use.

1713
02:58:27.486 --> 02:58:28.326
Right.

1714
02:58:30.166 --> 02:58:32.666
There are even more exotic lots

1715
02:58:32.666 --> 02:58:37.666
because in some lot formulas, as I said,

1716
02:58:38.726 --> 02:58:41.726
there are even more exotic lots

1717
02:58:38.960 --> 02:58:51.120
an angle or its ruler, the prenatal lunation or its lord or a given degree can also stand.

1718
02:58:41.726 --> 02:58:44.726
because in some lot formulas, as I said,

1719
02:58:44.726 --> 02:58:47.726
there are even more exotic lots

1720
02:58:47.726 --> 02:58:48.726
because in some lot formulas,

1721
02:58:51.120 --> 02:58:58.000
And as I also promised, I told you that I would speak about

1722
02:58:58.000 --> 02:58:59.120
the

1723
02:58:58.909 --> 02:59:07.909
some whole sign lots, which were developed precisely for whole sign lots.

1724
02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:08.400
the

1725
02:59:07.909 --> 02:59:12.909
And it looks like Dorotheus's livelihood, a lot of livelihood,

1726
02:59:12.909 --> 02:59:17.909
which is from the lot of the second place to the second place itself,

1727
02:59:17.909 --> 02:59:23.909
is one of these lots, because in Dorotheus's

1728
02:59:23.473 --> 02:59:31.993
work there is no allusion whatsoever to the cost so if it is not the first

1729
02:59:31.993 --> 02:59:41.073
degree that is understood for the second place its first degree then we have no

1730
02:59:41.073 --> 02:59:44.593
idea how we could

1731
02:59:43.521 --> 02:59:52.521
calculate a degree-wise lot for the Dorotheus's livelihood.

1732
02:59:52.521 --> 02:59:58.521
The same is true for violence's exaltation because

1733
02:59:58.521 --> 03:00:05.521
all the violence tells about the exaltation degrees

1734
03:00:05.432 --> 03:00:09.432
later on in book three.

1735
03:00:05.521 --> 03:00:08.521
of the exaltation degree.

1736
03:00:08.521 --> 03:00:12.521
So, the exaltation degree is the degree of the exaltation

1737
03:00:13.432 --> 03:00:17.432
He actually in book two

1738
03:00:17.432 --> 03:00:21.432
he just instructs the reader

1739
03:00:21.432 --> 03:00:25.432
to look at the governing light.

1740
03:00:25.432 --> 03:00:29.432
So the sun by day and the moon by night.

1741
03:00:29.432 --> 03:00:33.432
And

1742
03:00:29.775 --> 03:00:37.775
and count the signs from this light to the sign of its exaltation

1743
03:00:37.775 --> 03:00:43.775
and to cast this interval from the ascendant.

1744
03:00:43.775 --> 03:00:47.775
We also have some other

1745
03:00:47.775 --> 03:00:51.775
examples of this.

1746
03:00:48.255 --> 03:01:04.375
projection points. So Dorotheus and Valens have lots that are cast not from the, from

1747
03:00:51.775 --> 03:00:55.775
So, we have the example of the

1748
03:00:55.775 --> 03:00:58.775
light of the ascendant.

1749
03:01:04.375 --> 03:01:08.095
the Ascendant but from the moon.

1750
03:01:08.628 --> 03:01:13.628
from Saturn and from Venus, basically.

1751
03:01:13.628 --> 03:01:22.628
And in these cases, I guess I'm still puzzled why this is done in this way.

1752
03:01:22.628 --> 03:01:32.628
So I don't really know in these cases why they deviate from the usual practice.

1753
03:01:32.646 --> 03:01:36.646
of projecting lots from the Ascendant.

1754
03:01:44.646 --> 03:01:48.646
But at least in the case of Dorotheus' death,

1755
03:01:48.646 --> 03:01:53.646
which is from the Moon to the 8th place,

1756
03:01:53.646 --> 03:01:56.646
and projected from Saturn, again,

1757
03:01:56.646 --> 03:02:00.646
the Moon is projected from the 8th place,

1758
03:01:56.906 --> 03:02:09.486
obviously a whole sign lot, we can rearrange this formula as looking at the

1759
03:02:09.486 --> 03:02:17.626
distance from the moon to Saturn in some ways, let's say

1760
03:02:16.328 --> 03:02:21.328
the moon, which is the quickest of the planets,

1761
03:02:21.328 --> 03:02:31.328
and which is associated with health and life and change and growth

1762
03:02:31.328 --> 03:02:35.328
and generation.

1763
03:02:35.328 --> 03:02:41.328
And we also look at Saturn,

1764
03:02:41.666 --> 03:02:46.666
which is the slowest, the end, death, destruction,

1765
03:02:49.786 --> 03:02:52.586
and we project this from the eighth place,

1766
03:02:52.586 --> 03:02:57.586
which is associated with death itself.

1767
03:02:58.026 --> 03:03:01.946
So we can perhaps find some local logic here

1768
03:03:01.946 --> 03:03:03.446
if we really want to.

1769
03:03:03.644 --> 03:03:11.964
But as I mentioned, there is no comprehensive logic that can be found.

1770
03:03:11.964 --> 03:03:22.404
And also we have basically no surviving horoscopic examples of how they used.

1771
03:03:23.057 --> 03:03:31.637
these lots. The only exception is violence is exaltation, which is used by him, and

1772
03:03:31.637 --> 03:03:34.457
zine is anonymous in some horoscopes of his.

1773
03:03:42.882 --> 03:03:46.222
So with this, I would like to get to the end

1774
03:03:46.222 --> 03:03:51.222
of my presentation and to come up with the final reflections.

1775
03:03:57.722 --> 03:03:58.882
The first of all is that

1776
03:03:59.580 --> 03:04:18.460
lots are not real. So if someone prefers astronomical reality and wants to base their practice on

1777
03:04:18.460 --> 03:04:20.900
astronomical reality, then

1778
03:04:20.900 --> 03:04:21.180
[pause]

1779
03:04:21.784 --> 03:04:33.784
Maybe the only lot that could be derived, could be accepted is the Lot of Fortune, understood as a sort of lunar ascendant.

1780
03:04:33.784 --> 03:04:38.784
Or even it should be eliminated as well.

1781
03:04:38.784 --> 03:04:42.784
Still, I guess that many astrologers

1782
03:04:42.784 --> 03:04:50.784
...

1783
03:04:44.616 --> 03:04:55.496
would like to include lots in their practice, especially because they can add more insight

1784
03:04:55.496 --> 03:05:02.616
into the issues or they can provide some means of differentiation

1785
03:05:04.776 --> 03:05:05.276
and

1786
03:05:05.044 --> 03:05:10.044
when the places themselves do not provide this opportunity.

1787
03:05:14.164 --> 03:05:19.024
For example, discerning the mother from the father,

1788
03:05:22.964 --> 03:05:26.684
which could be attained by looking

1789
03:05:26.684 --> 03:05:29.484
at natural significators as well.

1790
03:05:29.649 --> 03:05:44.649
But maybe there are some astrologers who would say that more refined insights can be reached if plots are also considered.

1791
03:05:44.649 --> 03:05:52.649
So all in all, I don't think that it would be too much to claim that

1792
03:05:54.693 --> 03:06:00.693
Lots can be really useful for astrological practical work.

1793
03:06:01.693 --> 03:06:05.693
But if someone goes with lots,

1794
03:06:06.693 --> 03:06:13.693
should make some considerations, I guess, not to be inconsistent.

1795
03:06:14.688 --> 03:06:27.648
For example, decide whether fortune and fate should be unreversed lots and in this case

1796
03:06:27.648 --> 03:06:36.448
fortune will be lunar under every circumstance and fate will be solar.

1797
03:06:37.236 --> 03:06:47.236
or they should be reversed but then understood as switching lunar and solar corrector by night.

1798
03:06:48.236 --> 03:06:58.236
Also, it should be considered whether of the traditional lots

1799
03:07:02.012 --> 03:07:14.012
The hermetic calculations are accepted or discarded. What one does with lots like siblings and children

1800
03:07:14.652 --> 03:07:18.732
and the other trivial or exotic lots.

1801
03:07:20.091 --> 03:07:35.331
Also, the question occurs that whether traditional lot formulas should be accepted without criticism

1802
03:07:35.331 --> 03:07:44.931
or even if there are some noun formulas coming from any source, like some obscure list of

1803
03:07:44.931 --> 03:07:45.931
lots.

1804
03:07:45.916 --> 03:07:59.616
These should be accepted or these should be discarded and the astrologer should calculate

1805
03:07:45.931 --> 03:07:46.931
Okay.

1806
03:07:46.931 --> 03:07:49.931
So, let's go back to the question.

1807
03:07:59.616 --> 03:08:05.536
or devise lot formulas by themselves.

1808
03:08:06.015 --> 03:08:09.355
for a given purpose on the spot.

1809
03:08:14.255 --> 03:08:19.255
Which might be necessary if someone wants to fill the gap

1810
03:08:21.455 --> 03:08:22.375
and wants to

1811
03:08:24.375 --> 03:08:26.635
(murmurs)

1812
03:08:25.556 --> 03:08:36.056
device lots for for grandparents or for six sisters or uncles or cousins or something like that.

1813
03:08:37.556 --> 03:08:49.556
And finally, the question also occurs whether lots should be reserved for birds. And of course, if someone extends their practice to

1814
03:08:51.031 --> 03:08:57.031
mundane astrology, general astrology to general astrological charts,

1815
03:08:57.031 --> 03:09:03.031
or they should be also included in, let's say, horror charts,

1816
03:09:03.031 --> 03:09:13.031
where the use of lots is basically, apart from the lot of fortune,

1817
03:09:13.031 --> 03:09:17.031
is unseen among modern practitioners.

1818
03:09:17.031 --> 03:09:20.031
[silence]

1819
03:09:17.122 --> 03:09:22.682
Of course, I can't provide any answers to these questions, but I think this is very

1820
03:09:22.682 --> 03:09:31.882
important to make individual decisions on this and to go with it to avoid inconsistency

1821
03:09:31.882 --> 03:09:43.802
and haphazard arbitrary decisions made for different horoscopes.

1822
03:09:43.802 --> 03:09:46.802
So finally, the bibliography.

1823
03:09:45.947 --> 03:09:54.267
I just want to say a couple of words about the sources that I found are most important.

1824
03:09:57.147 --> 03:10:06.667
There is this essay by Chris Brennan about the reasons of how the seven hermetic lots were

1825
03:10:07.117 --> 03:10:14.997
devised. I guess it's interesting to see, to read for those who are interested in this

1826
03:10:14.997 --> 03:10:16.517
topic.

1827
03:10:16.517 --> 03:10:27.597
Dorian Greenbaum provided a list of horoscopes with fortune and fate.

1828
03:10:28.094 --> 03:10:34.094
which is almost comprehensive, at least it was really comprehensive at that time,

1829
03:10:35.094 --> 03:10:46.094
which can be interesting to see for those who want to study the use of these lots in actual horoscopes.

1830
03:10:50.094 --> 03:10:55.094
In her book, The Diamond in Hellenistic Astrology,

1831
03:10:57.871 --> 03:11:07.871
The horoscopes using desire and constraint are also found.

1832
03:11:07.871 --> 03:11:23.871
But this is the best monograph on this issue of daemon, fate, genius, inner voice, and how it is

1833
03:11:24.457 --> 03:11:33.457
conceptualized in astrology in relation to fortune.

1834
03:11:33.457 --> 03:11:44.457
She also has a recent article under the title "Abhumashara and the Tradition of Planetary Lots in Astrology"

1835
03:11:44.457 --> 03:11:48.457
in which the

1836
03:11:48.641 --> 03:12:00.721
She investigates the background of Abu Ma'shar's list of the seven planetary lots, which are

1837
03:12:00.721 --> 03:12:13.001
partly the four principal lots and partly the seven hermetic lots.

1838
03:12:13.378 --> 03:12:21.378
So this is also an interesting and detailed investigation.

1839
03:12:21.378 --> 03:12:39.378
Stefan Heiland's Adriana Genitura contains a lengthy analysis of the sources on the Lotta of Fortune with the primary sources in German.

1840
03:12:39.378 --> 03:12:42.378
So it is also

1841
03:12:41.217 --> 03:12:47.377
an important source. And finally I would like to highlight Eric Lusby's

1842
03:12:47.377 --> 03:12:56.657
blog post and especially his PDF document

1843
03:12:56.657 --> 03:13:02.897
about the lots which is today the most comprehensive treatment.

1844
03:13:01.664 --> 03:13:04.744
of the lot formulas.

1845
03:13:04.744 --> 03:13:07.984
Okay, so that's all.

1846
03:13:07.984 --> 03:13:08.984
Thank you very much.
